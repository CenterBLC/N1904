When working with Text-Fabric datasets that consist of a large number of files (such as the [CenterBLC/N1904 dataset](https://github.com/CenterBLC/N1904), has at least 60 files), this rate limit can be easily reached during the loading process, effectively blocking loading of the full dataset by any unauthenticated user.\n",

Whenever a user downloads the [**latest** release](https://github.com/CenterBLC/N1904/releases/latest), the Text-Fabric code downloads this zip file without using the risk of hitting the rate limit. **Hence, most users will not hit this rate limit when using the latest dataset, provided this includes a complete.zip file.** See also the Text-Fabric documentation on how this is done by the dataprovider [using A.zipall()](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/advanced/repo.html#github).\n",
