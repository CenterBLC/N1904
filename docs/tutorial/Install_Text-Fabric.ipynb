    "Since Text-Fabric is a Python package, it requires Python to be installed on your system. Make sure you have at least [Python 3.7.0](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/about/install.html). If you do not have Python installed yet, you can use a package manager like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), which provides a Jupyter Notebook environment along with the Python setup. For more details you can refer to [this Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/CenterBLC/N1904/tree/main/docs/tutorial/Install_Python.ipynb) for installation instructions."
