# Nestle 1904 GNT - Feature: lemma

Feature group | Feature type | Data type | Available for node types | Used by viewtypes
---  | --- | --- | --- | ---
[`Lexical`](featuresbygroup.md#lexical-features) | [`Node`](featuresbyfeaturetype.md#node-features) | [`string`](featuresbydatatype.md#string-datatype) |  [`word`](featuresbynodetype.md#word-nodes) [`subphrase`](featuresbynodetype.md#subphrase-nodes) [`phrase`](featuresbynodetype.md#phrase-nodes) | [`syntax-view`](../syntax-view.md#start) [`wg-view`](../wg-view.md#start)

## Feature description

The `lemma` feature represents the lexical lemma according to the Bible Dictionary of Ancient Greek (BDAG) and/or ANLEX by Friberg, Friberg, and Miller. This feature helps in identifying the base form of a word as used in dictionaries.

This feature is also populated for `phrase` or `subphrase`, but only if they consist of just one `word` node.

## Notes

When using the [Bible Online Learner](http://www.dadel.org/) as an aid in exploring text and creating Text-Fabric queries, it is advisable to use the [bol_lemma](bol_lemma.md#start) feature instead of this one to circumvent potential issues arising from a slightly different handling of Unicode codepoints.

See also feature [variant](variant.md#start).

## Source description

This feature is derived from the XML attribute `lemma` of the tag `w` (word).
