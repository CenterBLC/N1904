# Nestle 1904 GNT - Feature: subjref

## Feature description

Subject reference to one or more nodes.

This feature is also populated for `phrase` or `subphrase`, but only if they consist of just one `word` node.

## Feature values

`word` node values.

## Notes

The "Subject Reference" feature is implemented as an edge feature within the data structure. Its usage can be seen in the following example, where the feature is applied in a structured query. The following examples shows two nodes being reported:

<pre>
E.subjref.f(514)
  (524, 533)
</pre>

This snippet indicates that the node with identifier 514 has a subject reference connection to nodes 524 and 533.

To demonstrate the practical application of this feature, consider the following query example:

<pre>
SubQuery = '''
clause
  w1:word 
  w2:word 
  w1 -subjref> w2
'''
SubResults = PLAY.search(SubQuery)
  0.17s 7755 results
</pre>

This query illustrates how to retrieve relationships where one word (w1) has a subject reference to another word (w2).

## Source description

Based upon (optional) XML attribute `subjref` of tag `w` (word).
