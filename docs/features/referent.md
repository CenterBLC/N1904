## Feature description

The `referent` feature stores information about the entity (usually a pronoun) to which the current node refers. The value of the referent often crosses sentence and verse boundaries and is, to a certain extent, more of a discourse feature than a syntactic one.

This feature is also populated for `phrase` or `subphrase`, but only if they consist of just one `word` node.

## Feature values

The [id](id.md#start) of the referent according to the following format:

```
An 'n' followed by a 11-digit unique id in the format
    BBCCCVVVWWW
    BB          => zero-padded book, NT starts at 40
      CCC       => zero-padded chapter
         VVV    => zero-padded verse
            WWW => zero-padded word index (instance within the verse)
```

## Notes

The following image demonstrates how feature `referent` links back to [`id`](id.md#start). In this example the ὑμῖν and ἡμῶν in Philippians 1:2 refers back to the ἁγίοις in verse 1:

See also the following related features:
   * [framespec](framespec.md#start): Reference to the id of subject, object or idirect object.
   * [frame](frame.md#start): Edge feature that links nodes that are part of the frame; labelled as A0, A1, etc.
   * [id](id.md#start): A uniqe identifier for each individual word in the corpus.
   * [subjrefspec](subjrefspec.md#start): Subject reference to a node id.
 

## Source description

This feature is derived from the optional XML tag `referent` of node `w`. Annotation data originates from [Clear Bible](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-greek/tree/main/sources/Clear/annotations).
