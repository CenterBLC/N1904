# Nestle 1904 GNT - Feature: domain

Feature group | Feature type | Data type | Available for node types | Used in viewtypes
---  | --- | --- | --- | ---

## Feature description

The `domain` feature specifies the semantic domain according to the Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Greek (SDBG). This feature helps to categorize words based on their meanings and semantic fields.

This feature is also populated for `phrase` or `subphrase`, but only if they consist of just one `word` node.

## Feature values

domain (this feature) | Comment | Frequency<sup>1</sup>
--- | --- | ---
xxxyyy  | Lexical Domain value| 126757
'' | Empty | 11022

<sup>1</sup> Frequency figures are listed for word nodes only.

## Interpreting the data

Feature `domain` is *to some extent* equivalent to a numerical representation of feature [`ln`](ln.md#start) and can be decoded using the following method. Take for example lex_domain = "089007". The 6-digit value "089007" first need to be split into two 3-digit parts: "087" and "007". The second part should be interpreted as a alphabetic (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, ..., Z=26). Taken the two parts together, this will result in 89G, which points to an entry in Louw-Nida. For this example (i.e. 89G) this maps to main section [relations](https://www.laparola.net/greco/louwnida.php?sezmag=89) and subsection [Cause and/or Reason](https://www.laparola.net/greco/louwnida.php?sezmag=89&sez1=15&sez2=38).

It is important to realize that the granularity of feature `domain` is less than that of feature [`ln`](ln.md#readme). Consider for example the ἀρχή in John 1:1. According to Louw-Nida Lexicon this can map to either a:beginning (aspect)=>68.1 or b:beginning (time)=>67.65. In Text-Fabric one value is attached to feature `domain`, which is `067003`. Using the above explained method, this breaks down to "067" and "003" where the last part refers to section "C", which is actualy a range [(67.65-67.72)](https://www.laparola.net/greco/louwnida.php#67) within Louw Nida.

## Source description

This feature is derived from the XML attribute `domain` of the tag `w` (word). The word sense data for this feature was compiled by the United Bible Societies MARBLE project. See [Macula-Greek Licence](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-greek/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
