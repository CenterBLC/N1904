This Github repository houses a comprehensive dataset for the Greek New Testament (Nestle 1904, seventh edition: reprint 1913), enabling linguistic and textual analytics through the Python package [Text-Fabric](https://centerblc.github.io/N1904/tf.html). One of the main features is the ability to present the Greek text as [a syntax tree](https://centerblc.github.io/N1904/syntaxtrees.html) using constituency grammar, reflecting the hierarchical arrangement of grammatical elements within the sentence.
