Joseph
the
husband
of Mary
out of
whom
was born
Jesus
the [One]
being called
Christ
All
therefore
the
generations
from
Abraham
to
David [were]
generations
fourteen
and
from
David
until
the
carrying away
to Babylon
generations
fourteen
and
from
the
carrying away
to Babylon
until
the
Christ
generations
fourteen
-
Now
of Jesus
Christ
the
birth
thus
came about
Having been pledged
the
mother
of Him
Mary
-
to Joseph
before
rather
coming together
of them
she was found
in
womb
having [a child]
out of
[the] Spirit
Holy
Joseph
now
the
husband
of her
righteous
being
and
not
willing
her
to expose publicly
purposed
secretly
to send away
her
These things
now
of him
having pondered
behold
an angel
of [the] Lord
in
a dream
appeared
to him
saying
Joseph
son
of David
not
you should fear
to receive
Mary
[as] the
wife
of you
that
for
in
her
having been conceived
from
[the] Spirit
is
Holy
She will bear
then
a son
and
you will call
the
name
of Him
Jesus
He
for
will save
the
people
of Him
from
the
sins
of them
This
then
all
has come to pass
that
may be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
the Lord
through
the
prophet
saying
Behold
the
virgin
in
womb
will hold
and
will bear
a son
and
they will call
the
name
of Him
Immanuel
which
is
being translated
With
us
-
God
Having been awoken
then
-
Joseph
from
the
sleep
he did
as
had commanded
him
the
angel
of [the] Lord
and
received
the
wife
of him
and
not
knew
her
until
that
she had brought forth
a son
and
he called
the
name
of Him
Jesus
-
Now
Jesus
having been born
in
Bethlehem
-
of Judea
in
[the] days
of Herod
the
king
behold
Magi
from [the]
east
arrived
in
Jerusalem
saying
Where
is
the [One]
having been born
King
of the
Jews
We saw
for
of Him
the
star
in
the
east
and
are come
to worship
Him
Having heard
then
-
King
Herod
he was troubled
and
all
Jerusalem
with
him
And
having gathered together
all
the
chief priests
and
scribes
of the
people
he was inquiring
of
them
where
the
Christ
was to be born
-
And
they said
to him
In
Bethlehem
-
of Judea
thus
for
has it been written
through
the
prophet
And
you
Bethlehem
land
of Judah
by no means
least
are
among
the
rulers
of Judah
out
of you
for
will go forth
[One] leading
who
will shepherd
the
people
of Me
-
Israel
Then
Herod
secretly
having called
the
Magi
inquired exactly
of
them
the
time
of the
appearing
star
And
having sent
them
to
Bethlehem
he said
Having gone
search
carefully
for
the
Child
when
then
You shall have found [Him]
bring word back
to me
so that
I also
having come
may worship
Him
-
And
having heard
the
king
they went away
and
behold
the
star
which
they saw
in
the
east
went before
them
until
having arrived
it stood
over
where
was
the
Child
Having seen
now
the
star
they rejoiced [with]
joy
great
exceedingly
And
having come
into
the
house
they found
the
Child
with
Mary
the
mother
of Him
and
having fallen down
they worshiped
Him
and
having opened
the
treasures
of them
they offered
to Him
gifts
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
And
having been divinely warned
in
a dream
not
to return
to
Herod
by
another
route
they withdrew
into
the
country
of them
Having withdrawn
then
of them
behold
an angel
of [the] Lord
appears
in
a dream
-
to Joseph
saying
Having arisen
take
the
Child
and
the
mother
of Him
and
flee
into
Egypt
and
remain
there
until
-
I should tell
you
is about
for
Herod
to seek
the
Child
-
to destroy
Him
-
And
having arisen
he took
the
Child
and
the
mother
of Him
by night
and
withdrew
into
Egypt
and
he remained
there
until
the
death
of Herod
so that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
[the] Lord
through
the
prophet
saying
Out
of Egypt
have I called
the
Son
of me
Then
Herod
having seen
that
he had been outwitted
by
the
Magi
was enraged
intensely
and
having sent forth
he put to death
all
the
boys
that [were]
in
Bethlehem
and
in
all
the
vicinity
of it
from
two years old
and
under
according to
the
time
which
he had ascertained
from
the
Magi
Then
was fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
A voice
in
Ramah
was heard
weeping
and
mourning
great
Rachel
weeping [for]
the
children
of her
and
not
would
be comforted
because
no more
are they
Having died
now
-
of Herod
behold
an angel
of [the] Lord
appears
in
a dream
to
Joseph
in
Egypt
saying
Having arisen
take
the
Child
and
the
mother
of Him
and
go
into
[the] land
of Israel
they have died
for
those
seeking
the
life
of the
Child
-
And
having arisen
he took
the
Child
and
the
mother
of Him
and
came
into
[the] land
of Israel
Having heard
now
that
Archelaus
reigns over
-
Judea
in place of
the
father
of him
Herod
he was afraid
there
to go
having been divinely warned
now
in
a dream
he withdrew
into
the
district
-
of Galilee
and
having come
he dwelt
in
a city
being called
Nazareth
so that
it should be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
through
the
prophets
that
A Nazarene
He will be called
In
then
the
days
those
comes
John
the
Baptist
preaching
in
the
wilderness
-
of Judea
saying
Repent
has drawn near
for
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
This
for
is
the [One]
having been spoken of
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
[The] voice
of one crying
in
the
wilderness
Prepare
the
way
of [the] Lord
straight
make
the
paths
of Him
Himself
now
-
John
had
the
garment
of him
of
hair
of a camel
and
a belt
of leather
around
the
waist
of him
-
and
the food
was
of him
locusts
and
honey
wild
At that time
were going out
to
him
Jerusalem
and
all
-
Judea
and
all
the
region around
the
Jordan
and
were being baptized
in
the
Jordan
River
by
him
confessing
the
sins
of them
Having seen
now
many
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
coming
to
the
baptism
he said
to them
Brood
of vipers
who
forewarned
you
to flee
from
the
coming
wrath
Produce
therefore
fruit
worthy
-
of repentance
And
not
presume
to say
within
yourselves
[As] father
we have
-
Abraham
I say
for
to you
that
able is
-
God
out of
the
stones
these
to raise up
children
unto
Abraham
Already
now
the
ax
to
the
root
of the
trees
is applied
every
therefore
tree
not
producing
fruit
good
is cut down
and
into
[the] fire
is thrown
I
indeed
you
baptize
with
water
to
repentance
-
but
after
me
is coming
mightier
than I
He
of whom
not
I am
fit
the
sandals
to carry
He
you
will baptize
with
[the] Spirit
Holy
and
with fire
whose
-
winnowing fork [is]
in
the
hand
of Him
and
He will clear
the
threshing floor
of Him
and
will gather
the
wheat
of Him
into
the
barn
the
but
chaff
He will burn up
with fire
unquenchable
Then
comes
-
Jesus
from
-
Galilee
to
the
Jordan
unto
-
John
-
to be baptized
by
him
-
But
was hindering
Him
saying
I
need
have
by
You
to be baptized
and
You
come
to
me
Answering
however
-
Jesus
said
him
Permit [it]
presently
thus
for
fitting
it is
to us
to fulfill
all
righteousness
Then
he permits
Him
Having been baptized
now
-
Jesus
immediately
went up
from
the
water
and
behold
were opened
the
heavens
and
he saw
Spirit
God
descending
as
a dove
alighting
upon
Him
And
behold
a voice
out
of the
heavens
saying
This
is
the
Son
of me
the
beloved
in
whom
I was well pleased
Then
-
Jesus
was led up
into
the
wilderness
by
the
Spirit
to be tempted
by
the
devil
And
having fasted
days
forty
and
forty
nights
afterward
He was hungry
And
having come
the
[one] tempting
he said
to Him
If
Son
You are
-
of God
speak
that
the
stones
these
loaves of bread
might become
-
But
answering
He said
It has been written
Not
by
bread
alone
shall live
the
man
but
by
every
word
coming out
of
[the] mouth
of God
Then
takes
Him
the
devil
to
the
holy
city
and
sets
Him
upon
the
pinnacle
of the
temple
and
says
to him
If
Son
You are
-
of God
throw
Yourself
down
it has been written
for
-
To the
angels
of Him
He will give orders
concerning
You
and
in
[their] hands
will they bear up
You
lest
ever
You strike
against
a stone
the
foot
of You
Said
to him
-
Jesus
Again
it has been written
Not
you shall test
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
Again
takes
Him
the
devil
to
a mountain
high
exceedingly
and
shows
to Him
all
the
kingdoms
of the
world
and
the
glory
of them
and
he says
to Him
These things
to You
all
will I give
if
falling down
You will worship
me
Then
says
to him
-
Jesus
Get you away
Satan
it has been written
for
[The] Lord
the
God
of you
you shall worship
and
Him
alone
shall you serve
Then
leaves
Him
the
devil
and
behold
angels
came
and
were ministering
to Him
Having heard
now
that
John
had been delivered up
He withdrew
into
-
Galilee
And
having left
-
Nazareth
having come
he dwelt
at
Capernaum
which
[is] on the sea-side
in
[the] region
of Zebulun
and
Naphtali
that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
Land
of Zebulun
and
land
of Naphtali
way
of [the] sea
beyond
the
Jordan
Galilee
of the
Gentiles
The
people
-
sitting
in
darkness
a light
have seen
great
and
to those
sitting
in [the]
land
and
shadow
of death
a light
has dawned
on them
From
that time
began
-
Jesus
to proclaim
and
to say
Repent
has drawn near
for
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Walking
now
beside
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
He saw
two
brothers
Simon
-
called
Peter
and
Andrew
the
brother
of him
casting
a net
into
the
sea
they were
for
fishermen
And
He says
to them
Come follow
after
Me
and
I will make
you
fishers
of men
-
And
immediately
having left
the
nets
they followed
Him
And
having gone on
from there
He saw
others
two
brothers
James
the [son]
-
of Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
of him
in
the
boat
with
Zebedee
the
father
of them
mending
the
nets
of them
and
He called
them
-
And
immediately
having left
the
boat
and
the
father
of them
they followed
Him
And
He was going
throughout
all
-
Galilee
teaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
and
proclaiming
the
gospel
of the
kingdom
and
healing
every
disease
and
every
sickness
among
the
people
And
went out
the
news
of Him
into
all
-
Syria
And
they brought
to Him
all
the
sick
having
various
diseases
and
pains
oppressing
being possessed by demons
and
being epileptics
and
paralytics
and
He healed
them
And
followed
Him
crowds
great
from
-
Galilee
and
[the] Decapolis
and
Jerusalem
and
Judea
and
beyond
the
Jordan
Having seen
then
the
crowds
He went up
on
the
mountain
and
having sat down
of Him
came
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
And
opening
the
mouth
of Him
He was teaching
them
saying
Blessed [are]
the
poor
in the
spirit
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Blessed [are]
those
mourning
for
they
will be comforted
Blessed
the
meek
for
they
will inherit
the
earth
Blessed [are]
those
hungering
and
thirsting for
-
righteousness
for
they
will be filled
Blessed [are]
the
merciful
for
they
will receive mercy
Blessed
the
pure
-
in heart
for
they
-
God
will see
Blessed
the
peacemakers
for
they
sons
of God
will be called
Blessed [are]
those
having been persecuted
on account of
righteousness
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Blessed
are you
when
they shall insult
you
and
shall persecute [you]
and
shall say
all kinds of
evil
against
you
lying
on account of
Me
Rejoice
and
exult
for
the
reward
of you
[is] great
in
the
heavens
thus
for
they persecuted
the
prophets
-
before
you
You
are
the
salt
of the
earth
if
however
the
salt
becomes tasteless
with
what
will it be salted
For
nothing
it is potent
any longer
if
not
having been cast
out
to be trampled upon
by
-
men
You
are
the
light
of the
world
Not
is able
a city
to be hidden
on
a hill
lying
Nor
do they light
a lamp
and
put
it
under
-
a basket
but
upon
the
lampstand
and
it shines
for all
those
in
the
house
Thus
let shine
the
light
of you
before
-
men
so that
they may see
your
-
good
works
and
they should glorify
the
Father
of you
-
in
the
heavens
Not
think
that
I have come
to abolish
the
law
or
the
Prophets
not
I have come
to abolish
but
to fulfill
Truly
for
I say
to you
until
-
shall pass away
the
heaven
and
the
earth
iota
one
or
one
stroke of a letter
no
not
shall pass away
from
the
law
until
-
everything
should happen
Whoever
if
then
shall break
one
of the
commandments
of these
the
least
and
shall teach
so
the
others
least
he will be called
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
whoever
now
-
shall keep
and
shall teach [them]
this [one]
great
will be called
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
I say
for
to you
that
if
not
shall abound
your
-
righteousness
above [that]
of the
scribes
and
Pharisees
no
not
shall you enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
You have heard
that
it was said
to the
ancients
Not
you shall murder
whoever
now
-
shall murder
liable
will be
to the
judgment
I
however
say
to you
that
everyone
-
being angry with
the
brother
of him
liable
will be
to the
judgment
whoever
now
-
shall say
to
brother
of him
Raca
liable
will be
to the
Sanhedrin
whoever
now
-
shall say
Fool
liable
will be
to
the
hell
-
of fire
If
therefore
you shall offer
the
gift
of you
at
the
altar
and there
shall remember
that
the
brother
of you
has
something
against
you
leave
there
the
gift
of you
before
the
altar
and
go away
first
be reconciled
to
brother
of you
and
then
having come
offer
the
gift
of you
Be
agreeing
with
accuser
of you
quickly
while
which
you are
with
him
on
the
way
lest
ever
you
deliver
the
accuser
to the
judge
and
the
judge
to the
officer
and
into
prison
you will be cast
Truly
I say
to you
no
not
shall you come out
from there
until
-
you should pay
the
last
kodranten
You have heard
that
it was said
Not
shall you commit adultery
I
however
say
to you
that
everyone
-
looking upon
a woman
in order
-
to lust after
her
already
has committed adultery with
her
in
the
heart
of him
If
now
the
eye
of you
-
right
causes to stumble
you
pluck out
it
and
cast [it]
from
you
it is better
indeed
for you
that
should perish
one
of the
members
of you
and
not
all
the
body
of you
should be cast
into
hell
And
if
the
right
of you
hand
causes to stumble
you
cut off
it
and
cast [it]
from
you
it is better
indeed
for you
that
should perish
one
of the
members
of you
and
not
all
the
body
of you
into
hell
should depart
It was said
also
Whoever
-
shall divorce
the
wife
of him
let him give
to her
a letter of divorce
I
however
say
to you
that
everyone
-
divorcing
the
wife
of him
except
on account
of sexual immorality
causes
her
to commit adultery
And
whoever
if
her having been divorced
shall marry
commits adultery
Again
you have heard
that
it was said
to the
ancients
Not
shall you swear falsely
you shall keep
now
to the
Lord
the
oaths
of you
I
however
say
to you
not
to swear
at all
neither
by
-
heaven
because
[the] throne
it is
-
of God
nor
by
the
earth
because
[the] footstool
it is
of the
feet
of Him
nor
by
Jerusalem
because
[the] city
it is
of the
great
King
Neither
by
the
head
of you
shall you swear
because
not
you are able
one
hair
white
to make
or
black
Let it be
however
the
statement
of you
Yes
âYes
[and] âNo
No
The
however
more than
these
from
-
evil
comes
You have heard
that
it was said
Eye
for
eye
and
tooth
for
tooth
I
however
say
to you
not
to resist
the
evil [person]
Instead
whoever
you
shall strike
on
the
right
cheek
of you
turn
to him
also
the
other
and
to the one
willing
you
to sue
and
the
tunic
of you
to take
yield
to him
also
the
cloak
and
whoever
you
shall compel to go
mile
one
go
with
him
two
To the [one]
asking of
you
give
and
the [one]
desiring
from
you
to borrow
not
you shall turn away from
You have heard
that
it was said
You shall love
-
neighbor
of you
and
shall hate
-
enemy
of you
I
however
say
to you
love
the
enemies
of you
and
pray
for
those
persecuting
you
so that
you may be
sons
of the
Father
of you
who is
in
[the] heavens
For
the
sun
of Him
He makes rise
on
evil
and
good
and
He sends rain
on
righteous
and
unrighteous
If
for
you love
those
loving
you
what
reward
have you
Do not
also
the
tax collectors
the
same
do
And
if
you greet
the
brothers
of you
only
what
extraordinary
do you
Do not
also
the
Gentiles
the
same
do
Shall be
therefore
you
perfect
as
the
Father
of you
who [is]
Heavenly
perfect
is
Beware
now
the
righteousness
of you
not
to do
before
-
men
in order
-
to be seen
by them
if
now
otherwise
reward
not
have you
with
the
Father
of you
who [is]
in
the
heavens
When
therefore
you do
acts of charity
not
do sound a trumpet
before
you
as
the
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
streets
so that
they may have glory
from
-
men
Truly
I say
to you
they have
the
reward
of them
You
however
doing
charity
not
let know
the
left [hand]
of you
what
is doing
the
right hand
of you
so that
may be
your
-
giving
in
-
secret
And
the
Father
of you
the [One]
seeing
in
-
secret
will reward
you
And
when
you pray
not
you shall be
like
the
hypocrites
for
they love
in
the
synagogues
and
on
the
corners
of the
streets
standing
to pray
so that
they might be seen
-
by men
Truly
I say
to you
they have
the
reward
of them
You
however
when
you pray
enter
into
the
room
of you
and
having shut
the
door
of you
pray
to
Father
of you
the [One]
in
-
secret
And
the
Father
of you
the [One]
seeing
in
-
secret
will reward
you
Praying
now
not
do use vain repetitions
like
the
pagans
they think
for
that
in
the
many words
of them
they will be heard
Not
therefore
be like
to them
knows
for
the
Father
of you
of what things
need
you have
before
-
your
asking
Him
Thus
therefore
pray
you
Father
of us
who [is]
in
the
heavens
hallowed be
the
name
of You
Come
the
kingdom
of You
be done
the
will
of You
as
in
heaven
[so] also
upon
earth
The
bread
of us
-
daily
grant
us
today
And
forgive
us
the
debts
of us
as
also
we
forgive
the
debtors
of us
And
not
lead
us
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
-
evil
If
for
you forgive
-
men
the
trespasses
of them
will forgive
also
you
the
Father
of you
-
Heavenly
If
however
not
you forgive
-
men
neither
the
Father
of you
will forgive
the
trespasses
of you
Whenever
now
you fast
not
be
like
the
hypocrites
gloomy
they disfigure
for
the
appearance
of them
so that
they might appear
-
to men
[as] fasting
Truly
I say
to you
they have
the
reward
of them
You
however
fasting
anoint
your
-
head
and
the
face
of you
wash
so that
not
you might appear
-
to men
[as] fasting
but
-
to Father
your
the [One]
in
-
secret
and
the
Father
of you
the [One]
seeing
in
-
secret
will reward
you
Not
store up
for yourselves
treasures
upon
the
earth
where
moth
and
rust
destroy
and
where
thieves
break in
and
steal
store up
however
for yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
destroy
and
where
thieves
not
do break in
nor
steal
Where
for
is
the
treasure
of you
there
will be
also
the
heart
of you
The
lamp
of the
body
is
the
eye
If
therefore
is
the
eye
of you
clear
[the] whole
-
body
of you
full of light
will be
If
however
the
eye
of you
evil
is
all
the
body
of you
full of darkness
will be
If
then
the
light
that [is]
within
you
darkness
is
that
darkness
how great
No one
is able
two
masters
to serve
either
for
the
one
he will hate
and
the
other
he will love
or
[the] one
he will be devoted to
and
the
other
he will despise
Not
you are able
God
to serve
and
money
Because of
this
I say
to you
not
be anxious about
the
life
of you
what
you should eat
or
what
you should drink
nor
the
body
of you
what
you should put on
Not
the
life
more
is
than the
food
and
the
body
than
clothing
Look
at
the
birds
of the
air
that
not
they sow
nor
do they reap
nor
do they gather
into
barns
and
the
Father
of you
-
Heavenly
feeds
them
Not
you
much
are more valuable
than they
Who
now
from
you
being anxious
is able
to add
to
the
lifespan
of him
hour
one
And
about
clothing
why
are you anxious
Observe
the
lilies
of the
field
how
they grow
[They do] not
labor
nor
do they spin
I say
however
to you
that
not even
Solomon
in
all
the
glory
of him
was adorned
like
one
of these
If
however
the
grass
of the
field
today
being [here]
and
tomorrow
into
the furnace
being thrown
-
God
thus
clothes
[will He] not
much
more
you
O [you] of little faith
Not
therefore
be anxious
saying
What
shall we eat
Or
what
shall we drink
Or
what
shall we wear
All
for
these things
the
Gentiles
seek after
knows
for
the
Father
of you
-
Heavenly
that
you have need
of them
all
Seek
however
first
the
kingdom
and
the
righteousness
of Him
and
these things
all
will be added
to you
Not
therefore
be anxious
about
things
tomorrow
-
for
tomorrow
will be anxious about
itself
Sufficient
to the
day [is]
the
trouble
of it
Not
do judge
that
not
you should be judged
With
whatever
for
verdict
you judge
you will be judged
and
with
whatever
measure
you measure
it will be measured again
to you
Why
now
do you look at
the
splinter
that [is]
in
the
eye
the
brother
of you
-
and
the in
-
your [own]
eye
beam
not
notice
Or
how
shall you say
to the
brother
of you
Permit that
I might cast out
the
splinter
from
the
eye
of you
and
behold
the
beam
[is] in
the
eye
of you
Hypocrite
Cast out
first
from
the
eye
of you
the
beam
and
then
you will see clearly
to cast out
the
splinter
from
the
eye
of the
brother
of you
Not
give
that which [is]
holy
to the
dogs
nor
cast
the
pearls
of you
before
the
pigs
not
lest
they shall trample upon
them
with
the
feet
of them
and
having turned
they tear to pieces
you
Ask
and
it will be given
to you
seek
and
you will find
knock
and
it will be opened
to you
Everyone
for
-
asking
receives
and
the [one]
seeking
finds
and
to the [one]
knocking
it will be opened
Or
which
is
of
you
a man
whom
will ask for
the
son
of him
bread
not
a stone
will he give
him
Or
also
a fish
he will ask for
not
a serpent
will he give
him
If
therefore
you
evil
being
know
gifts
good
to give
to the
children
of you
how much
more
the
Father
of you
who [is]
in
the
heavens
will give
good things
to those
asking
Him
All things
therefore
as many as
if
you might desire
that
should do
to you
the
men
so
also
you
do
to them
This
for
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
Enter
through
the
narrow
gate
For
wide [is]
the
gate
and
broad
the
way
-
leading
to
-
destruction
and
many
are
those
entering
through
it
For
small [is]
the
gate
and
compressed
the
way
-
leading
to
-
life
and
few
are
those
finding
it
But beware
of
the
false prophets
who
come
to
you
in
clothing
of sheep
inwardly
however
they are
wolves
ravenous
By
the
fruits
of them
you will know
them
Not
do they gather
from
thorns
grapes
or
from
thistles
figs
So
every
tree
good
fruits
good
produces
-
but
the bad
tree
fruits
bad
produces
Not
is able
a tree
good
fruits
bad
to produce
nor
a tree
bad
fruits
good
to produce
Every
tree
not
producing
fruit
good
is cut down
and
into
fire
is thrown
Then surely
by
the
fruits
of them
you will know
them
Not
everyone
-
saying
to Me
Lord
Lord
will enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
but
the [one]
doing
the
will
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
the
heavens
Many
will say
to Me
in
that
the
day
Lord
Lord
not
in
Your
name
did we prophesy
and
[in]
Your
name
demons
cast out
and
[in]
your
name
miracles
many
perform
And
then
I will declare
to them
-
Never
knew I
you
depart you
from
Me
those
working
-
lawlessness
Everyone
therefore
whoever
hears
My
-
words
these
and
does
them
will be like
a man
wise
who
built
his
-
house
upon
the
rock
And
came down
the
rain
and
came
the
torrents
and
blew
the
winds
and
beat
that
house
upon
and
not
it fell
it had been founded
for
upon
the
rock
And
everyone
-
hearing
My
-
words
these
and
not
doing
them
he will be likened
to a man
foolish
who
built
of him
the
house
upon
the
sand
And
came down
the
rain
and
came
the
torrents
and
blew
the
winds
and
beat
that
house
upon
and
it fell
and
was
the
fall
of it
great
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
the
words
these
were astonished
the
crowds
at
the
teaching
of Him
He was
for
teaching
them
as
authority
having
and
not
as
the
scribes
of them
Having come down
now
He
from
the
mountain
followed
Him
crowds
great
And
behold
a leper
having come
was worshipping
Him
saying
Lord
if
You are willing
You are able
me
to cleanse
And
having stretched out
the
hand
He touched
him
saying
I am willing
be you cleansed
And
immediately
was cleansed
his
-
leprosy
And
says
to him
-
Jesus
See that
no one
you tell
But
go
yourself
show
to the
priest
and
offer
the
gift
that
commanded
Moses
for
a testimony
to them
Having entered
now
He
into
Capernaum
came
to Him
a centurion
imploring
Him
and
saying
Lord
the
servant
of me
is lying
in
the
house
paralyzed
grievously
tormented
He says
to him
I
having come
will heal
him
Answering
however
the
centurion
said
Lord
not
I am
worthy
that
of me
under
the
roof
You should come
but
only
speak
the word
and
will be healed
the
servant
of me
Also
for
I
a man
am
under
authority
having
under
me
soldiers
and
I say
to this [one]
Go
and
he goes
and
to another
Come
and
he comes
and
to
[the] servant
of me
Do
this
and
he does [it]
Having heard
now
-
Jesus
marveled
and
said
to those
following
Truly
I say
to you
except
no one
so great
faith
in
-
Israel
have I found
I say
now
to you
that
many
from
east
and
west
will come
and
will recline
with
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
the
however
sons
of the
kingdom
will be cast out
into
the
darkness
the
outer
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
And
said
-
Jesus
to the
centurion
Go
as
you have believed
be it
to you
And
was healed
the
servant
in
the
hour
that
And
having come
-
Jesus
to
the
house
of Peter
He saw
the
mother-in-law
of him
lying sick
and
fevering
And
He touched
the
hand
of her
and
left
her
the
fever
and
she arose
and
was ministering
to them
Evening
now
having come
they brought
to Him
being possessed with demons
many
and
He cast out
the
spirits
by a word
and
all
those
sick
being
He healed
so that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
Himself
the
infirmities
of us
He took
and
our
diseases
bore
Having seen
now
-
Jesus
crowd
around
Him
He commanded
to depart
to
the
other side
And
having come to [him]
one
scribe
said
to Him
Teacher
I will follow
You
wherever
if
You might go
And
says
to him
-
Jesus
-
Foxes
holes
have
and
the
birds
of the
air
nests
-
but
the Son
-
of Man
no
has
[place] where
the
head
He might lay
Another
now
of the
disciples
said
to Him
Lord
allow
me
first
to go
and
to bury
the
father
of me
-
But
Jesus
said
to him
Follow
Me
and
leave
the
dead
to bury
-
their own
dead
And
having entered
He
into
the
boat
followed
Him
the
disciples
of Him
And
behold
a storm
great
arose
in
the
sea
so that
the
boat
was being swamped
by
the
waves
He Himself
however
was sleeping
And
having come to [Him]
they awoke
Him
saying
Lord
save us
we are perishing
And
He says
to them
Why
fearful
are you
O [you] of little faith
Then
having arisen
He rebuked
the
winds
and
the
sea
and
there was
a calm
great
-
And
the men
marveled
saying
What kind [of man]
is
this
that
even
the
winds
and
the
sea
Him
obey
And
having come
He
to
the
other side
to
the
region
of the
Gadarenes
met
Him
two
being possessed by demons
out of
the
tombs
coming forth
violent
extremely
so that
not
was able
anyone
to pass
by
the
way
that
And
behold
they cried out
saying
What
to us
and
to you
Son
-
of God
Are You come
here
before [the]
time
to torment
us
There was
now
far off
from
them
a herd
of pigs
many
feeding
-
And
the demons
were begging
Him
saying
If
You cast out
us
send away
us
into
the
herd
-
of pigs
And
He said
to them
Go
-
And
having gone out
they went away
into
the
pigs
and
behold
rushed
all
the
herd
down
the
steep bank
into
the
sea
and
perished
in
the
waters
Those
now
feeding [them]
fled
and
having gone away
into
the
city
they related
everything
including
the [matter]
of those
being possessed by demons
And
behold
all
the
city
went out
to
meet
-
Jesus
And
having seen
Him
they begged [Him]
that
He would depart
from
the
region
of them
And
having entered
into
a boat
He passed over
and
came
to
the
own
city
And
behold
they were bringing
to Him
a paralytic
on
a bed
lying
And
having seen
-
Jesus
the
faith
of them
He said
to the
paralytic
Take courage
son
have been forgiven
of you
the
sins
And
behold
some
of the
scribes
said
to
themselves
This [man]
blasphemes
And
having known
-
Jesus
the
thoughts
of them
He said
So that
why
think you
evil
in
the
hearts
of you
Which
for
is
easier
to say
Are forgiven
of you
the
sins
or
to say
Arise
and
walk
So that
however
you may know
that
authority
has
the
Son
-
of Man
on
the
earth
to forgive
sins
Then
He says
to the
paralytic
Having arisen
take up
your
-
mat
and
go
to
the
house
of you
And
having arisen
he went away
to
the
house
of him
Having seen
now
the
crowds
marveled
and
glorified
-
God
the [One]
having given
authority
such
-
to men
And
passing on
-
Jesus
from there
He saw
a man
sitting
at
the
tax booth
Matthew
named
And
He says
to him
Follow
Me
And
having arisen
he followed
Him
And
it came to pass
of Him
reclining
in
the
house
that
behold
many
tax collectors
and
sinners
having come
were reclining with
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
And
having seen [it]
the
Pharisees
said
to
disciples
of Him
Because of
why
with
the
tax collectors
and
sinners
eats
the
Teacher
of you
-
And
having heard
He said
Not
need
have
those
being strong
of a physician
but
those
sick
being
Having gone
however
learn
what
is
Mercy
I desire
and
not
sacrifice
Not
for
I came
to call
[the] righteous
but
sinners
Then
come
to Him
the
disciples
of John
saying
Because of
why
we
and
the
Pharisees
do fast
the
however
disciples
of You
not
fast
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
Not
can
the
sons
of the
bridechamber
mourn
as
long as
with
them
is
the
bridegroom
Will come
however
days
when
shall have been taken away
from
them
the
bridegroom
and
then
they will fast
No one
however
puts
a patch
of cloth
unshrunk
on
clothing
old
tears away
for
the
patch
of it
from
the
garment
and
a worse
tear
emerges
Nor
pour they
wine
new
into
wineskins
old
if
now
lest
are burst
the
wineskins
and
the
wine
is poured out
and
the
wineskins
are destroyed
But
they pour
wine
new
into
wineskins
new
and
both
are preserved
These things
of Him
speaking
to them
behold
a ruler
certain
having come
was kneeling down
to Him
saying
-
The
daughter
of Me
presently
has died
but
having come
lay
the
hand
of You
upon
her
and
she will live
And
having arisen
-
Jesus
followed
him
also
the
disciples
of Him
And
behold
a woman
having had a flux of blood
twelve
years
having come up
behind [Him]
touched
the
fringe
of the
garment
of Him
She was saying
for
within
herself
If
only
I shall touch
the
garment
of Him
I will be healed
-
And
Jesus
having turned
and
having seen
her
said
Take courage
daughter
the
faith
of you
has cured
you
And
was cured
the
woman
from
the
hour
very
And
having come
-
Jesus
into
the
house
of the
ruler
and
having seen
the
flute players
and
the
crowd
making a commotion
He says
Go away
Not
for
is dead
the
girl
but
sleeps
And
they began to laugh at
Him
When
now
had been put outside
the
crowd
having entered
He took hold of
the
hand
of her
and
arose
the
girl
And
went out
the
report
this
into
all
the
land
that
And
passing on
from there
-
Jesus
followed
two
blind [men]
crying out
and
saying
Have mercy on
us
Son
of David
Having come
now
into
the
house
came
to Him
the
blind [men]
and
says
to them
-
Jesus
Believe you
that
I am able
this
to do
They say
to him
Yes
Lord
Then
He touched
the
eyes
of them
saying
According to
the
faith
of you
be it
to you
And
were opened
their
-
eyes
And
strictly instructed
them
-
Jesus
saying
See that
no one
knows
-
But
having gone out
they make known
Him
in
all
the
land
that
[As] they
now
were going out
behold
they brought
to Him
mute
possessed by a demon
And
having been cast out
the
demon
spoke
the
mute [man]
And
marveled
the
crowds
saying
Never
was it seen
thus
in
-
Israel
The
now
Pharisees
were saying
By
the
prince
of the
demons
He casts out
-
demons
And
was going throughout
-
Jesus
the
cities
all
and
the
villages
teaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
and
proclaiming
the
gospel
of the
kingdom
and
healing
every
disease
and
every
sickness
Having seen
now
the
crowds
He was moved with compassion
for
them
because
they were
wearied
and
cast away
as
sheep
not
having
a shepherd
Then
He says
to the
disciples
of Him
The
indeed
harvest
[is] plentiful
the
however
workmen
[are] few
Beseech
therefore
the
Lord
of the
harvest
that
He might send out
workmen
into
the
harvest
of Him
And
having summoned
the
twelve
disciples
of Him
He gave
to them
authority
over spirits
unclean
so as
to cast out
them
and
to heal
every
disease
and
every
sickness
-
And
of the twelve
apostles
the
names
are
these
first
Simon
-
called
Peter
and
Andrew
the
brother
of him
and
James
the [son]
of
Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
of him
Philip
and
Bartholomew
Thomas
and
Matthew
the
tax collector
James
the [son]
-
of Alphaeus
and
Thaddaeus
Simon
the
Zealot
and
Judas
-
Iscariot
the [one]
also
having betrayed
Him
These
-
twelve
sent forth
-
Jesus
having instructed
them
saying
Into
[the] way
of the Gentiles
not
go off
and
into
any city
of [the] Samaritans
not
enter
go
however
rather
to
those
sheep
-
being lost
of [the] house
of Israel
Going on
also
proclaim
saying
-
Has drawn near
The
kingdom
of the
heavens
[Those] ailing
heal
dead
raise
lepers
cleanse
demons
cast out
freely
you received
freely
give
Neither
take along
gold
nor
silver
nor
copper
in
the
belts
of you
nor
provision-bag
for
[the] way
nor
two
tunics
nor
sandals
nor
a staff
worthy [is]
for
the
workman
of the
provisions
of him
Into
whatever
now
-
city
or
village
you enter
inquire
who
in
it
worthy
is
and there
remain
until
-
you go forth
Entering
now
into
the
house
greet
it
And
if
indeed
be
the
house
worthy
let come
the
peace
of you
upon
it
if
however
not
it be
worthy
the
peace
of you
to
you
let return
And
whoever
-
not
will receive
you
nor
will hear
the
words
of you
going forth
out
of the
house
or
of the
city
that
shake off
the
dust
of the
feet
of you
Truly
I say
to you
More tolerable
it will be
for [the] land
of Sodom
and
of Gomorrah
on
day
of judgment
than
the
city
for that
Behold
I
send forth
you
as
sheep
in
[the] midst
of wolves
be you
therefore
shrewd
as
the
serpents
and
innocent
as
the
doves
Beware
however
of
-
men
they will deliver
for
you
into
courts
and
in
the
synagogues
of them
they will flog
you
and
before
governors
also
and
kings
you will be brought
on account of
Me
for
a testimony
to them
and
to the
Gentiles
When
then
they deliver up
you
not
be anxious
how
or
what
you should speak
it will be given
for
you
in
that
-
hour
what
you should say
Not
for
you
are
those
speaking
but
the
Spirit
of the
Father
of you
-
speaking
through
you
Will deliver up
now
brother
brother
to
death
and
father
child
And
will rise up
children
against
parents
and
will put to death
them
And
you will be
hated
by
all
on account of
the
name
of Me
the [one]
however
having endured
to
[the] end
he
will be saved
Whenever
then
they persecute
you
in
the
city
one
flee
to
the
next
Truly
for
I say
to you
no
not
shall you have completed
the
cities
of
Israel
until
be come
the
Son
of
Man
Not
is
a disciple
above
the
teacher
nor
a servant
above
the
master
of him
[It is] sufficient
for the
disciple
that
he become
as
the
teacher
of him
and
the
servant
as
the
master
of him
If
the
master of the house
Beelzebul
they called
how much
more
those
house members
of him
Not
therefore
you should fear
them
nothing
for
is
concealed
which
not
will be revealed
or
hidden
which
not
will be known
What
I tell
you
in
the
darkness
speak
in
the
light
and
what
in
the
ear
you hear
proclaim
upon
the
housetops
And
not
you should be afraid
of
those
killing
the
body
the
however
soul
not
being able
to kill
you should fear
however
rather
the [One]
being able
both
soul
and
body
to destroy
in
hell
Not
two
sparrows
for an assarion
are sold
And
one
of
them
not
will fall
to
the
ground
apart from
the
Father
of you
Of you
now
even
the
hairs
of the
head
all
numbered
are
Not
therefore
you should fear
than many
sparrows
are worth more
you
Everyone
therefore
who
will confess
in
Me
before
-
men
will confess
also I
in
him
before
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
the
heavens
Whoever
now
-
shall deny
Me
before
-
men
will deny
I also
him
before
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
the
heavens
Not
think
that
I came
to bring
peace
to
the
earth
not
I came
to bring
peace
but
a sword
I came
for
to set at variance
A man
against
the
father
of him
and
a daughter
against
the
mother
of her
and
a daughter-in-law
against
the
mother-in-law
of her
And
enemies
of the
man
the
household
of him
The [one]
loving
father
or
mother
above
Me
not
is
of Me
worthy
and
the [one]
loving
son
or
daughter
above
Me
not
is
of Me
worthy
And
he who
not
takes
the
cross
of him
and
follows
after
Me
not
is
of Me
worthy
The [one]
having found
the
life
of him
will lose
it
and
the [one]
having lost
the
life
of him
on account of
Me
will find
it
The [One]
receiving
you
Me
receives
and
the [one]
Me
receiving
receives
the [One]
having sent
Me
The [one]
receiving
a prophet
in [the]
name
of a prophet
[the] reward
of a prophet
will receive
and
the [one]
receiving
a righteous [man]
in [the]
name
of a righteous [man]
the reward
of a righteous [man]
will receive
And
whoever
-
shall give to drink
one
the
little ones
of these
a cup
of cold [water]
only
in [the]
name
of a disciple
truly
I say
to you
no
not
shall he lose
the
reward
of him
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
commanding
the
twelve
disciples
of Him
He departed
from there
-
to teach
and
to preach
in
the
cities
of them
-
And
John
having heard
in
the
prison
the
works
of the
Christ
having sent
two
of the
disciples
of him
said
to Him
You
are
the
coming [One]
or
another
are we to look for
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to them
Having gone
relate
to John
what
you hear
and
see
Blind
receive sight
and
lame
walk
lepers
are cleansed
and
deaf
hear
and
dead
are raised
and
poor
are gospelized
And
blessed
is
he who
if
not
shall fall away
in
Me
As these
now
were going away
began
-
Jesus
to speak
to the
crowds
concerning
John
What
went you out
into
the
wilderness
to see
A reed
by [the]
wind
shaken
But
what
did you go out
to see
A man
in
delicate [clothing]
having been dressed
Behold
those
-
delicate [clothing]
wearing
in
the
houses
-
of kings
But
what
did you go out
a prophet
to see
Yes
I say
to you
and [one]
more excellent
than a prophet
For this
is [he]
concerning
whom
it has been written
Behold
I
send
the
messenger
of Me
before
[the] face
of You
who
will prepare
the
way
of You
before
You
Truly
I say
to you
not
there has risen
among [those]
born
of women
one greater
than John
the
Baptist
-
Yet
the least
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
greater
than he
is
From
then
the
days
of John
the
Baptist
until
now
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
is taken by violence
and [the]
violent
claim
it
All
for
the
prophets
and
the
law
until
John
prophesied
And
if
you are willing
to receive [it]
he
is
Elijah
the one
being about
to come
The [one]
having
ears
let him hear
To what
however
will I compare
the
generation
this
Like
it is
little children
sitting
in
the
markets
and
calling out
-
to others
saying
We piped
for you
and
not
you did dance
we sang a dirge
and
not
you did wail
Came
for
John
neither
eating
nor
drinking
and
they say
A demon
he has
Came
the
Son
-
of Man
eating
and
drinking
and
they say
Behold
a man
a glutton
and
a drunkard
of tax collectors
a friend
and
of sinners
But
is justified
-
wisdom
by
the
deeds
of her
Then
He began
to denounce
the
cities
in
which
had taken place
the
most
miracles
of Him
because
not
they repented
Woe
to you
Chorazin
Woe
to you
Bethsaida
For
if
in
Tyre
and
Sidon
had taken place
the
miracles
-
having come to pass
in
you
long ago
then
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
they would have repented
But
I say
to you
for Tyre
and
Sidon
more tolerable
will it be
in
[the] day
of judgment
than
for you
And
you
Capernaum
not
to
heaven
will be exalted
to
Hades
will be brought down
For
if
in
Sodom
had taken place
the
miracles
-
having taken place
in
you
it would have remained
-
until
the
day
But
I say
to you
that
for [the] land
of Sodom
more tolerable
will it be
in
day
of judgment
than
for you
At
that
-
time
answering
-
Jesus
said
I fully consent
to You
Father
Lord
of the
heaven
and
the
earth
that
You did hide
these things
from
wise
and
learned
and
did reveal
them
to little children
Yes
-
Father
for
thus
well-pleasing
it was
before
You
All things
to Me
have been delivered
by
the
Father
of Me
And
no one
knows
the
Son
if
not
the
Father
nor
the
Father
anyone
does know
if
not
the
Son
and
to whom
if
might choose
the
Son
to reveal [Him]
Come
to
Me
all
those
toiling
and
being burdened
and I
will give rest
to you
Take
the
yoke
of Me
upon
you
and
learn
from
Me
for
gentle
I am
and
humble
[in] the
heart
and
you will find
rest
[for] the
souls
of you
The
for
yoke
of Me
[is] easy
and
the
burden
of Me
light
is
At
that
-
time
went
-
Jesus
on the
Sabbaths
through
the
grainfields
-
and
the disciples
of Him
were hungry
and
they began
to pluck [the]
heads of grain
and
to eat
-
And
the Pharisees
having seen
said
to Him
Behold
the
disciples
of You
are doing
what
not
it is lawful
to do
on
Sabbath
-
And
He said
to them
Not
you have read
what
did
David
when
he was hungry
and
those
with
him
how
he entered
into
the
house
-
of God
and
the
loaves
of the
presentation
they ate
which
not
lawful
it was
for him
to eat
nor
for those
with
him
if
not
for the
priests
only
Or
not
have you read
in
the
law
that
on the
Sabbath
the
priests
in
the
temple
the
Sabbath
profane
and
guiltless
are
I say
however
to you
that
the
temple
a greater than
is
here
If
however
you had known
what
is
Mercy
I desire
and
not
sacrifice
not
-
you would have condemned
the
guiltless
Lord
for
is
of the
Sabbath
the
Son
of
Man
And
having departed
from there
He went
into
the
synagogue
of them
And
behold
a man
a hand
having
withered
And
they asked
Him
saying
Is
it lawful
on the
Sabbaths
to heal
so that
they might accuse
Him
-
And
He said
to them
What
will there be
among
you
man
who
will have
sheep
one
and
if
falls
it
on the
Sabbaths
into
a pit
not
will he take hold of
it
and
will raise [it] up
How much
therefore
is more valuable
a man
than a sheep
Therefore
it is lawful
on the
Sabbaths
good
to do
Then
He says
to
[the] man
Stretch out
your
-
hand
And
he stretched [it] out
and
it was restored
sound
as
the
other
Having gone out
now
the
Pharisees
a counsel
held
against
Him
how
Him
they might destroy
-
And
Jesus
having known
withdrew
from there
And
followed
Him
great
and
He healed
them
all
and
He warned
them
that
not
known
Him
they should make
so that
might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying
Behold
the
servant
of Me
whom
I have chosen
the
beloved
of Me
whom
has found delight
the
soul
of Me
I will put
the
Spirit
of Me
upon
Him
and
justice
to the
Gentiles
He will proclaim
Not
will He quarrel
nor
will he cry out
nor
will hear
anyone
in
the
streets
the
voice
of Him
A reed
bruised
not
He will break
and
a wick
smoldering
not
He will quench
until
-
He leads
to
victory
-
justice
And
in the
name
of Him
[the] Gentiles
will hope
Then
was brought
to Him
[one] possessed by a demon
blind
and
mute
and
He healed
him
in order for
the
mute [man]
to speak
and
to see
And
were amazed
all
the
crowds
and
were saying
Whether
this
is
the
son
of David
-
And
the Pharisees
having heard
said
This [man]
not
casts out
the
demons
if
not
by
-
Beelzebul
prince
of the
demons
Having known
now
the
thoughts
of them
He said
to them
Every
kingdom
having been divided
against
itself
is brought to desolation
and
every
city
or
house
having been divided
against
itself
not
will stand
And
if
-
Satan
-
Satan
casts out
against
himself
he is divided
How
then
will stand
the
kingdom
of him
And
if
I
by
Beelzebul
cast out
-
demons
the
sons
of you
by
whom
do they cast out
On account of
this
they
judges
will be
of you
If
however
by [the]
Spirit
of God
I
cast out
-
demons
then
has come
upon
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
Or
how
is able
anyone
to enter
into
the
house
of the
strong [man]
and
the
goods
of him
to plunder
if
not
first
he bind
the
strong [man]
And
then
the
house
of him
he will plunder
The [one]
not
being
with
Me
against
Me
is
and
the [one]
not
gathering
with
Me
scatters
Because of
this
I say
to you
every
sin
and
blasphemy
will be forgiven
-
men
-
however
against
[the] Spirit
blasphemy
not
will be forgiven
And
whoever
if
speaks
a word
against
the
Son
-
of Man
it will be forgiven
him
whoever
now
-
speaks
against
-
Spirit
the
Holy
not
it will be forgiven
him
neither
in
this
-
age
nor
in
the
coming [one]
Either
make
the
tree
good
and
the
fruit
of it
good
or
make
the
tree
bad
and
the
fruit
of it
bad
by
for
the
fruit
the
tree
is known
Offspring
of vipers
how
are you able
good things
to speak
evil
being
Out of
for
the
abundance
of the
heart
the
mouth
speaks
The
good
man
out of
his
good
treasure
puts forth
good things
and
the
evil
man
out of
his
evil
treasure
puts forth
evil things
I say
now
to you
that
every
word
careless
that
will speak
-
men
they will give
of
it
an account
in
day
of judgment
By
for
the
words
of you
you will be justified
and
by
the
words
of you
you will be condemned
Then
answered
him
some
of the
scribes
and
Pharisees
saying
Teacher
we wish
from
You
a sign
to see
-
And
answering
He said
to them
A generation
evil
and
adulterous
a sign
seeks for
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
if
not
the
sign
of Jonah
the
prophet
Just as
for
was
Jonah
in
the
belly
of the
great fish
three
days
and
three
nights
so
will be
the
Son
-
of Man
in
the
heart
of the
earth
three
days
and
three
nights
The men
of Nineveh
will stand up
in
the
judgment
with
the
generation
this
and
will condemn
it
for
they repented
at
the
preaching
of Jonah
and
behold
greater
than Jonah
here
The queen
of [the] south
will rise up
in
the
judgment
with
the
generation
this
and
will condemn
it
for
she came
from
the
ends
of the
earth
to hear
the
wisdom
of Solomon
and
behold
greater
than Solomon
here
When
now
the
unclean
spirit
is gone out
from
the
man
it passes
through
waterless
places
seeking
rest
and
none
finds [it]
Then
it says
To
the
house
of me
I will return
from where
I came out
And
having come
it finds [it]
being unoccupied
and
swept
and
put in order
Then
it goes
and
takes
with
itself
seven
other
spirits
more evil
than itself
and
having entered in
they dwell
there
and
becomes
the
last
of the
man
that
worse
than the
first
So
it will be
also
unto
generation
this
the
evil
While
He
was speaking
to the
crowds
behold
the
mother
and
the
brothers
of Him
were standing
outside
seeking
to Him
to speak
Said
now
someone
to Him
Behold
the
mother
of You
and
the
brothers
of you
outside
are standing
seeking
to You
to speak
-
And
answering
He said
to the [one]
telling
Him
Who
is
the
mother
of Me
and
who
are
the
brothers
of Me
And
having stretched out
the
hand
of Him
to
the
disciples
of Him
He said
Behold
the
mother
of Me
and
the
brothers
of Me
Whoever
for
-
shall do
the
will
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
he
My
brother
and
sister
and
mother
is
In
the
day
that
having gone forth
-
Jesus
[from] the
house
was sitting
by
the
sea
And
were gathered together
to
Him
crowds
great
so that
He
into
a boat
having entered
sat down
and
all
the
crowd
on
the
shore
stood
And
He spoke
to them
many things
in
parables
saying
Behold
went out
the [one]
sowing
-
to sow
And
in
-
sowing
of him
some
indeed
fell
along
the
road
and
having come
the
birds
devoured
them
Other
now
fell
upon
the
rocky places
where
not
it had
soil
much
and
immediately
it sprang up
through
-
not
having
depth
of soil
[the] sun
now
having risen
they were scorched
and
through
the
not
having
root
were dried up
Other
now
fell
upon
the
thorns
and
grew up
the
thorns
and
choked
them
Other
now
fell
upon
the
soil
-
good
and
were yielding
fruit
some
indeed
a hundredfold
some
now
sixty
some
now
thirty
The [one]
having
ears
let him hear
And
having come to [Him]
the
disciples
said
to Him
Because of
why
in
parables
speak You
to them
-
And
answering
He said
Because
to you
it has been granted
to know
the
mysteries
of the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to them
however
not
it has been granted
Whoever
for
has
will be given
to him
and
he will be in abundance
whoever
now
not
has
even
what
he has
will be taken away
from
him
Because of
this
in
parables
to them
I speak
Because
seeing
not
do they see
and
hearing
not
do they hear
nor
do they understand
And
is fulfilled
in them
the
prophecy
of Isaiah
-
saying
In hearing
you will hear
and
no
not
understand
and
seeing
you will see
and
no
not
perceive
Has grown dull
for
the
heart
of the
people
this
and
with the
ears
barely
they have heard
and
the
eyes
of them
they have closed
not
lest
they should see
with the
eyes
and
with the
ears
they should hear
and
with the
heart
they should understand
and
should return
and
I will heal
them
Of you
however
blessed
[are] the
eyes
because
they see
and
the
ears
of you
because
they hear
Truly
for
I say
to you
that
many
prophets
and
righteous [men]
longed
to see
what
you see
and
not
saw
and
to hear
what
you hear
and
not
heard
You
therefore
hear
the
parable
of the [one]
having sown
Everyone
hearing
the
word
of the
kingdom
and
not
understanding
comes
the
evil one
and
snatches away
that
having been sown
in
the
heart
of him
This
is
the [one]
on
the
path
having been sown
That which
now
upon
the
rocky places
having been sown
this
is
the [one]
the
word
hearing
and
immediately
with
joy
receiving
it
no
he has
now
root
in
himself
but
temporary
is
having come
however
tribulation
or
persecution
on account of
the
word
immediately
he falls away
That which
now
among
the
thorns
having been sown
this
is
the [one]
the
word
hearing
and
the
care
-
present age
and
the
deceit
-
of riches
choke
the
word
and
unfruitful
it becomes
That
however
on
the
good
soil
having been sown
this
is
the [one]
the
word
hearing
and
understanding
who
indeed
brings forth fruit
and
produces
some
indeed
a hundredfold
some
now
sixty
some
now
thirty
Another
parable
put He before
them
saying
Has become like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a man
having sown
good
seed
in
the
field
of him
In
now
the [time]
are sleeping
the
men
came
his
-
enemy
and
sowed
weeds
in [the]
midst
of the
wheat
and
went away
When
now
sprouted
the
plants
and
fruit
produced
then
appeared
also
the
weeds
Having come to [him]
now
the
servants
the
master of the house
said
to him
Sir
not
good
seed
did you sow
in
-
your
field
How
then
has it
the weeds
-
And
he said
to them
An enemy
a man
this
did
-
And
the servants
to him
said
Do you desire
then
[that] having gone forth
we should gather
them
-
And
he said
No
not
lest
gathering
the
weeds
you would uproot
with
them
the
wheat
Allow
to grow together
both
until
the
harvest
and
in
the time
of the
harvest
I will say
to the
harvesters
Gather
first
the
weeds
and
bind
them
into
bundles
in order
-
to burn
them
-
and
the wheat
gather together
into
the
barn
of me
Another
parable
put He before
them
saying
Like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to a grain
of mustard
which
having taken
a man
sowed
in
the
field
of him
which
smallest
indeed
is
of all
the
seeds
when
however
it is grown
greater
than the
garden plants
it is
and
becomes
a tree
so that
come
the
birds
of the
air
and
perch
in
the
branches
of it
Another
parable
spoke He
to them
Like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to leaven
which
having taken
a woman
hid
in
of flour
measures
three
until
of it
was leavened
all
These things
all
spoke
-
Jesus
in
parables
to the
crowds
and
without
a parable
not
He was speaking
to them
so that
might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
the
prophet
saying
I will open
in
parables
the
mouth
of Me
I will utter
things hidden
from
[the] foundation
Then
having dismissed
the
crowds
He went
into
the
house
And
came
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
saying
Explain
to us
the
parable
of the
weeds
of the
field
-
And
answering
He said
The [One]
sowing
the
good
seed
is
the
Son
-
of Man
-
and
the field
is
the
world
-
and
the good
seed
these
are
the
sons
of the
kingdom
-
and
the weeds
are
the
sons
of the
evil [one]
-
and
the enemy
-
having sown
them
is
the
devil
-
and
the harvest
[the] consummation
of the age
is
-
and
the harvesters
angels
are
As
therefore
is gathered
the
weeds
and
in fire
is consumed
thus
it will be
in
the
consummation
of the
age
Will send forth
the
Son
-
of Man
the
angels
of Him
and
they will gather
out of
the
kingdom
of Him
all
the
causes of sin
and
those
practicing
-
lawlessness
and
they will cast
them
into
the
furnace
of the
fire
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
teeth
Then
the
righteous
will shine forth
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of the
Father
of them
The [one]
having
ears
let him hear
Like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
treasure
having been hidden
in
the
field
which
having found
a man
hid
and
for
the
joy
of it
goes
and
he sells
that
he has
and
buys
the
field
that
Again
like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a merchant
seeking
fine
pearls
having found
now
one
very precious
pearl
having gone away
he has sold
all things
as many as
he had
and
bought
it
Again
like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a dragnet
having been cast
into
the
sea
and
of
every
kind
having gathered together
which
when
it was filled
having drawn up
on
the
shore
and
having sat down
they collected
the
good
into
vessels
the
and
bad
out
they cast
Thus
will it be
in
the
consummation
of the
age
will go out
the
angels
and
will separate
the
evil
from
[the] midst
of the
righteous
and
will cast
them
into
the
furnace
of the
fire
There
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
Have you understood
these things
all
They say
to Him
Yes
-
And
He said
to them
Because of
this
every
scribe
having been discipled
into the
kingdom
of the
heavens
like
is
a man
a master of a house
who
puts forth
out of
the
treasure
of him
[things] new
and
old
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
the
parables
these
He withdrew
from there
And
having come
into
the
region
His [own]
He was teaching
them
in
the
synagogue
of them
so that
are astonished
they
and
are saying
From where
to this [man]
the
wisdom
this
and
the
miraculous powers
Not
this
is
the
of the
carpenter
Son
[Is] not
the
mother
of Him
called
Mary
And
the
brothers
of Him
James
and
Joseph
and
Simon
and
Judas
And
the
sisters
of Him
not
all
with
us
are
From where
then
to this [man]
these things
all
And
they were offended
at
Him
-
But
Jesus
said
to them
Not
is
a prophet
without Honor
if
not
in
the
hometown
and
in
the
household
of him
And
not
He did
there
miracles
many
because of
the
unbelief
of them
At
that
-
time
heard
Herod
the
tetrarch
the
news
of Jesus
and
he said
to
[the] servants
of him
This
is
John
the
Baptist
he
is risen
from
the
dead
and
because of
this
the
miraculous powers
are working
in
him
-
For
Herod
having seized
-
John
he bound
and
in
prison
put [him]
on account of
Herodias
the
wife
of Philip
the
brother
of him
Had been saying
for
-
John
to him
Not
it is lawful
for you
to have
her
Although
wishing
him
to kill
he feared
the
multitude
because
as
a prophet
him
they were holding
[The] birthday
now
having been celebrated
-
of Herod
danced
the
daughter
-
of Herodias
in
the
midst
and
pleased
-
Herod
whereupon
with
oath
he promised
to her
to give
whatever
if
she should ask
-
And
having been urged on
by
the
mother
of her
Give
me
she says
here
upon
a platter
the
head
of John
the
Baptist
And
having been grieved
the
king
on account of
the
oaths
and
those
reclining with [him]
he commanded [it]
to be given
And
he having sent
beheaded
John
in
the
prison
And
was brought
the
head
of him
on
a platter
and
was given
to the
girl
and
she brought [it]
to
[the] mother
of her
And
having come
the
disciples
of him
took
the
body
and
buried
it
and
having come
they told
-
Jesus
Having heard
now
-
Jesus
withdrew
from there
by
boat
to
a secluded
place
apart
Himself
And
having heard [of it]
the
crowds
followed
Him
on foot
from
the
towns
And
having gone out
He saw
great
a crowd
and
was moved with compassion
toward
them
and
healed
the
sick
of them
Evening
now
having come
came
to Him
the
disciples
saying
Desolate
is
this
place
and
the
time
already
is gone by
Dismiss
therefore
the
crowds
that
having gone
into
the
villages
they might buy
for themselves
food
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
No
need
they have
to go away
Give
to them
you
to eat
-
And
they say
to Him
Not
we have
here
if
not
five
loaves
and
two
fish
-
And
He said
Bring
to Me
here
them
And
having commanded
the
crowds
to sit down
on
the
grass
having taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish
having looked up
to
-
heaven
He spoke a blessing
and
having broken
He gave
to the
disciples
the
loaves
-
and
the disciples
to the
crowds
And
ate
all
and
were satisfied
and
they took up
that
being over and above
of the
fragments
twelve
hand-baskets
full
Those
then
eating
were
men
about
five thousand
besides
women
and
children
And
immediately
He compelled
the
disciples
to enter
into
the
boat
and
to go before
Him
to
the
other side
until
that
He would have dismissed
the
crowds
And
having dismissed
the
crowds
He went up
on
the
mountain
by
Himself
to pray
Evening
now
having arrived
alone
He was
there
-
And
the boat
now
stadia
many
from
the
land
being
tossed
by
the
waves
was
for
contrary [was]
the
wind
In [the] fourth
now
watch
of the
night
He went
to
them
walking
on
the
sea
-
And
the disciples
having seen
Him
on
the
sea
walking
were troubled
saying
-
A ghost
it is
And
in
-
fear
they cried out
Immediately
now
spoke
-
Jesus
to them
saying
Take courage
I
it is
not
fear
Answering
now
to Him
-
Peter
said
Lord
if
You
[it] is
command
me
to come
to
You
upon
the
waters
-
And
He said
Come
And
having descended
from
the
boat
Peter
walked
upon
the
water
and
came
to
-
Jesus
Seeing
now
the
wind
he was afraid
and
having begun
to sink
he cried out
saying
Lord
save
me
Immediately
now
-
Jesus
having stretched out
the
hand
took hold
of him
and
says
to him
[You] of little faith
of
why
did you doubt
And
having entered
they
into
the
boat
ceased
the
wind
Those
then
in
the
boat
worshiped
Him
saying
Truly
of God
Son
You are
And
having crossed over
they came
to
the
land
of
Gennesaret
And
having recognized
Him
the
men
the
place
of that
sent
to
all
the
surrounding region
that
and
brought
to Him
all
those
sick
being
and
they were begging
Him
that
only
they might touch
the
fringe
of the
garment
of Him
and
as many as
touched
were cured
Then
come
-
to Jesus
from
Jerusalem
Pharisees
and
scribes
saying
Because of
why
the
disciples
of You
break
the
tradition
of the
elders
Not
for
they wash
the
hands
when
bread
they shall eat
-
And
answering
He said
to them
Because of
why
also
you
break
the
commandment
-
of God
on account of
the
tradition
of you
-
For
God
commanded
Honor
the
Father
and
the
mother
and
The [one]
speaking evil of
father
or
mother
in death
must end
You
however
say
Whoever
-
shall say
to the
father
or
the
mother
[It is] a gift
whatever
if
by
me
you might be profited
no
not
he shall honor
the
father
of himself
or
the
mother
of himself
And
you made void
the
commandment
-
of God
on account of
the
tradition
of you
Hypocrites
Rightly
prophesied
concerning
you
Isaiah
saying
The
people
this
with the
lips
Me
it honors
the
however
heart
of them
far away
is kept
from
Me
in vain
then
they worship
Me
teaching [as]
doctrines
[the] precepts
of men
And
having called to [Him]
the
crowd
He said
to them
Hear
and
understand
Not
what
is entering
into
the
mouth
defiles
the
man
but
that
going forth
out of
the
mouth
this
defiles
the
man
Then
having come near
the
disciples
said
to Him
Know You
that
the
Pharisees
having heard
the
saying
were offended
-
And
answering
He said
Every
plant
that
not
has planted
the
Father
of Me
-
Heavenly
it will be rooted up
Leave
them
Blind
they are
guides
of the blind
Blind
now
blind
if
they lead
both
into
a pit
will fall
Answering
then
-
Peter
said
to Him
Explain
to us
the
parable
-
And
He said
Still
also
you
without understanding
are
Not yet
understand you
that
everything
-
entering
into
the
mouth
into
the
stomach
goes
and
into
[the] sewer
is cast out
The things
however
going forth
out of
the
mouth
out of
the
heart
come forth
and these
defile
the
man
Out of
for
the
heart
come forth
thoughts
evil
murders
adulteries
sexual immorality
thefts
false testimonies
slanders
These
are
the things
defiling
the
man
-
but
with unwashed
hands
to eat
not
defiles
the
man
And
having gone forth
from there
-
Jesus
withdrew
to
the
district
of Tyre
and
Sidon
And
behold
a woman
Canaanite
from
the
region
same
having approached
was crying out
saying
Have mercy on
me
Lord
Son
of David
the
daughter
of me
miserably
is possessed by a demon
-
And
not
He answered
her
a word
And
having come to [him]
the
disciples
of Him
were imploring
Him
saying
Dismiss
her
for
she cries out
after
us
-
And
answering
He said
Not
I was sent
if
not
to
the
sheep
-
being lost
of [the] house
of Israel
-
And
having come
she was worshiping
Him
saying
Lord
help
me
-
And
answering
He said
Not
it is
right
to take
the
bread
of the
children
and
to cast [it]
to the
dogs
-
And
she said
Yes
Lord
even
however
the
dogs
eat
of
the
crumbs
-
falling
from
the
table
of the
masters
of them
Then
answering
-
Jesus
said
to her
O
woman
great [is]
of you
the
faith
Be it
to you
as
you desire
And
was healed
the
daughter
of her
from
the
hour
that
And
having departed
from there
-
Jesus
went
along
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
and
having gone up
on
the
mountain
He was sitting
there
And
came
to Him
crowds
great
having
with
them
lame
crippled
blind
mute
and
others
many
and
they placed
them
at
the
feet
of Him
and
He healed
them
so that
the
crowd
marveled
seeing
mute
speaking
crippled
restored
and
lame
walking
and
blind
seeing
and
they glorified
the
God
of Israel
-
And
Jesus
having called to [him]
the
disciples
of Him
said
I am moved with compassion
toward
the
crowd
because
already
days
three
they continue
with Me
and
nothing
have
that
they might eat
and
to send away
them
hungry
not
I am willing
not
lest
they faint
on
the
way
And
say
to Him
the
disciples
From where
to us
in
a secluded place
loaves
so many
as
to satisfy
a crowd
so great
And
says
to them
-
Jesus
How many
loaves
have you
-
And
they said
Seven
and
a few
small fish
And
He having commanded
the
crowds
to sit down
on
the
ground
having taken
the
seven
loaves
and
the
fish
and
having given thanks
He broke [them]
and
was giving
to
disciples
-
and the
disciples
to the
crowd
And
ate
all
and
were satisfied
and
that
being over and above
of the
fragments
they took up
seven
baskets
full
Those
then
eating
were
four thousand
men
besides
women
and
children
And
having dismissed
the
crowds
He entered
into
the
boat
and
came
to
the
region
of Magadan
And
having approached
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
testing
asked
Him
a sign
out of
-
heaven
to show
them
-
And
answering
He said
to them
Evening
having come
you say
Fair weather
is red
for
the
sky
And
in the morning
Today
a storm
is red
for
being overcast
the
sky
The
indeed
appearance
of the
sky
you know [how]
to discern
-
but
the signs
of the
times
not
you are able
A generation
evil
and
adulterous
a sign
seeks
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
if
not
the
sign
of Jonah
And
having left
them
He went away
And
having come
the
disciples
to
the
other side
they forgot
bread
to take
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
Watch
and
beware
of
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
-
And
they were reasoning
among
themselves
saying
Because
bread
not
we took
Having known [this]
however
-
Jesus
said
Why
reason you
among
yourselves
O [you] of little faith
because
bread
not
you took
Not yet
do you understand
nor
remember
the
five
loaves
for the
five thousand
and
how many
hand-baskets
you gathered
Nor
the
seven
loaves
for the
four thousand
and
how many
baskets
you gathered
How
not
understand you
that
not
concerning
bread
I spoke
to you
to beware
also
of
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
Then
they understood
that
not
He said
to beware
of
the
leaven
of
bread
but
of
the
teaching
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
Having come
then
-
Jesus
into
the
district
of Caesarea
-
Philippi
He was questioning
the
disciples
of Him
saying
Whom
do pronounce
-
men
to be
the
Son
of
man
-
And
they said
Some
indeed
John
the
Baptist
others
now
Elijah
others
now
Jeremiah
or
one
of the
prophets
He says
to them
You
but
whom
Me
do you pronounce
to be
Answering
now
Simon
Peter
said
You
are
the
Christ
the
Son
of
God
the
living
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
to him
Blessed
are you
Simon
Barjona
For
flesh
and
blood
not
revealed [it]
to you
but
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
the
heavens
I also
now
to you
say
that
you
are
Peter
and
on
this
the
rock
I will build
My
-
church
and
[the] gates
of hades
not
will prevail against
it
I will give
to you
the
keys
of the
kingdom
of the
heavens
and
whatever
if
you might bind
on
the
earth
will be
bound
in
the
heavens
and
whatever
if
you might loose
on
the
earth
will be
loosed
in
the
heavens
Then
instructed He
the
disciples
that
to no one
they should say
that
He
is
the
Christ
From
that time
began
Jesus
Christ
to show
to the
disciples
of Him
that
it is necessary for
Him
to
Jerusalem
to go away
and
many things
to suffer
from
the
elders
and
chief priests
and
scribes
and
to be killed
and
on the
third
day
to be raised
And
having taken aside
Him
-
Peter
began
to rebuke
Him
saying
Far be it
from You
Lord
never
not
will be
to You
this
-
And
having turned
He said
-
to Peter
Get
behind
Me
Satan
A stumbling block
you are
to Me
For
not
your thoughts are of
the things
-
of God
but
the
things
of men
Then
-
Jesus
said
to
disciples
of Him
If
anyone
desires
after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
take up
the
cross
of him
and
follow
Me
Whoever
for
if
might desire
the
life
of him
to save
will lose
it
whoever
however
-
might lose
the
life
of him
on account of
Me
will find
it
What
for
will it profit
a man
if
the
world
whole
he gains
-
but
the soul
of him
loses
Or
what
will give
a man
[as] an exchange for
the
soul
of him
Is about
for
the
Son
of the
man
to come
in
the
glory
the
Father
of Him
with
the
angels
of Him
and
then
He will give
to each
according to
the
deeds
of him
Truly
I say
to you
-
there are
some
of those
here
standing
who
no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
they have seen
the
Son
-
of Man
coming
in
the
kingdom
of Him
And
after
days
six
takes with [Him]
-
Jesus
-
Peter
and
James
and
John
the
brother
of him
and
brings up
them
into
a mountain
high
by
themselves
And
He was transfigured
before
them
and
shone
the
face
of Him
like
the
sun
-
and
the clothes
of Him
became
white
as
the
light
And
behold
appeared
to them
Moses
and
Elijah
talking
with
Him
Answering
now
-
Peter
said
-
to Jesus
Lord
good
it is
for us
here
to be
If
You wish
I will make
here
three
tabernacles
for You
one
and
for Moses
one
and
for Elijah
one
While yet
he
was speaking
behold
a cloud
bright
overshadowed
them
and
behold
a voice
out of
the
cloud
saying
This
is
the
Son
of Me
the
beloved
in
whom
I am well pleased
Listen
to Him
And
having heard [it]
the
disciples
fell
upon
face
of them
and
were terrified
greatly
And
having come to [them]
-
Jesus
and
having touched
them
He said
Rise up
and
not
be afraid
Having lifted up
and
the
eyes
of them
no one
they saw
if
not
Himself
Jesus
alone
And
[as] were descending
they
from
the
mountain
instructed
them
-
Jesus
saying
To no one
tell
the
vision
until
that
the
Son
-
of Man
out from
[the] dead
is risen
And
asked
Him
the
disciples
saying
Why
then
the
scribes
say
that
Elijah
it behooves
to come
first
-
And
answering
He said
Elijah
indeed
comes
and
will restore
all things
I say
however
to you
that
Elijah
already
is come
and
not
they knew
him
but
did
to
him
whatever
they desired
Thus
also
the
Son
-
of Man
is about
to suffer
from
them
Then
understood
the
disciples
that
concerning
John
the
Baptist
He spoke
to them
And
they having come
to
the
crowd
came
to Him
a man
kneeling down to
Him
and
saying
Lord
have mercy on
my
-
son
for
he is epileptic
and
miserably
suffers
often
for
he falls
into
the
fire
and
often
into
the
water
And
I brought
him
to the
disciples
of You
and
not
they were able
him
to heal
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
O
generation
unbelieving
and
perverted
how long
when
with
you
will I be
How long
when
will I bear with
you
Bring
to Me
him
here
And
rebuked
him
-
Jesus
and
went out
from
him
the
demon
and
was healed
the
boy
from
the
hour
that
Then
having come
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
in
private
they said
Because of
why
we
not
were able
to cast out
it
-
And
He said
to them
Because of
the
little faith
of you
Truly
for
I say
to you
If
you have
faith
as
a seed
of mustard
you will say
to the
mountain
to this
Move
from here
to there
and
it will move
And
nothing
will be impossible
for you
Were abiding
now
they
in
-
Galilee
said
to them
-
Jesus
Is about
the
Son
-
of Man
to be betrayed
into
[the] hands
of men
and
they will kill
Him
and
on the
third
day
He will be raised up
And
they were grieved
deeply
Having come
now
they
to
Capernaum
came
those
the
didrachmas
collecting
-
to Peter
and
said
The
Teacher
of you
not
does he pay
didrachmas
He says
Yes
And
he having entered
into
the
house
anticipated
him
-
Jesus
saying
What
you
do think
Simon
The
kings
of the
earth
from
whom
do they receive
custom
or
tribute
From
the
sons
of them
or
from
-
strangers
He having said
now
From
the
strangers
said
to him
-
Jesus
Then
free
are
the
sons
That
however
not
we might offend
them
having gone
to
sea
cast
a hook
and
the
having come up
first
fish
take
and
having opened
the
mouth
of it
you will find
a four-drachma coin
That
having taken
give
to them
for
Me
and
yourself
In
that
-
hour
came
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
saying
Who
then
[the] greatest
is
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
And
having called to [Him]
a child
He set
it
in
midst
of them
and
said
Truly
I say
to you
if
not
you turn
and
become
as
the
little children
no
not
shall you enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Whoever
therefore
will humble
himself
as
the
little child
this
he
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
And
whoever
if
shall receive
one
little child
such
in
the
name
of Me
Me
receives
Whoever
then
-
shall cause to stumble
one
of the
little ones
of these
-
believing
in
Me
it is better
for him
that
should be hung
a millstone
heavy
around
the
neck
of him
and
he be sunk
in
the
depth
of the
sea
Woe
to the
world
because of
the
causes of sin
Necessary [are]
for
to come
the
stumbling blocks
but
woe
to the
man
by
whom
the
offense
comes
If
now
the
hand
of you
or
the
foot
of you
causes to sin
you
cut off
it
and
cast [it]
from
you
better
for you
it is
to enter
into
-
life
crippled
or
lame
than
two
hands
or
two
feet
having
to be cast
into
the
fire
-
eternal
And
if
the
eye
of you
causes to sin
you
gouge out
it
and
cast [it]
from
you
better
for you
it is
one-eyed
into
-
life
to enter
than
two
eyes
having
to be cast
into
the
hell
of the
fire
See [that]
not
you despise
one
of the
little ones
of these
I say
for
to you
that
the
angels
of them
in
[the] heavens
continually
always
behold
the
face
of the
Father
of me
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
What
you
do think
If
there should be
to any
man
a hundred
sheep
and
has gone astray
one
of
them
not
will he leave
the
ninety
nine
on
the
mountains
and
having gone
seek
the [one]
going astray
And
if
he should
find
it
truly
I say
to you
that
he rejoices
over
it
more
than
over
the
ninety
nine
-
not
having gone astray
Thus
not
it is
[the] will
of
the
Father
of you
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
that
should perish
one
of the
little ones
of these
If
now
sins
the
brother
of you
go
reprove
him
between
you
and
him
alone
If
you
he will hear
you have gained
the
brother
of you
If
however
not
he will hear
take
with
you
more
one
or
two
that
upon
[the] testimony
of two
witnesses
or
of three
may be strengthened
every
word
If
now
he fails to listen
to them
tell [it]
to the
church
If
now
also
to the
church
he fails to listen
let him be
to you
as
the
pagan
and
the
tax collector
Truly
I say
to you
how many
if
you shall bind
on
the
earth
shall have been
bound
in
heaven
and
how many
if
you shall loose
on
the
earth
shall have been
loosed
in
heaven
Again
truly
I say
to you
that
if
two
might agree
of
you
on
the
earth
concerning
any
matter
that
if
they shall ask
it will be done
for them
by
the
Father
of Me
who [is]
in
[the] heavens
Where
for
are
two
or
three
gathered together
unto
-
My
name
there
am I
in
[the] midst
of them
Then
having come
-
Peter
said
to Him
Lord
how often
will sin
against
me
the
brother
of me
and
I will forgive
him
Up to
seven times
Says
to him
-
Jesus
Not
I say
to you
up to
seven times
but
up to
seventy times
seven
Because of
this
has become like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to a man
a king
who
desired
to settle
accounts
with
the
servants
of him
Having begun
then
he
to settle
was brought
one
to him
a debtor
of ten thousand
talents
Nothing
having
now
he
to pay
commanded
him
the
master
to be sold
and
the
wife
and
the
children
and
all
as many as
he had
and
payment to be made
Having fallen down
therefore
the
servant
was bowing on his knees
to him
saying
Have patience
with
me
and
all
I will pay
to you
Having been moved with compassion
now
the
master
of the
servant
that
released
him
and
the
debt
forgave
him
Having gone out
however
the
servant
same
found
one
the
fellow servants
of him
who
was owing
him
a hundred
denarii
and
having seized
him
he was throttling [him]
saying
Pay
if
any
you owe
Having fallen down
therefore
the
fellow servant
of him
was begging
him
saying
Have patience
with
me
and
I will pay
you
-
But
not
he was willing
rather
having gone
he cast
him
into
prison
until
he should pay
that which
was owing
Having seen
therefore
the
fellow servants
of him
the things
having taken place
they were grieved
deeply
and
having gone
narrated
to
master
of themselves
all
that
having taken place
Then
having called to
him
the
master
of him
says
to him
Servant
evil
all
the
debt
that
I forgave
you
because
you begged
me
Not
did it behoove
also
you
to have pitied
the
fellow servant
of you
as
also I
you
had pitied
And
having been angry
the
master
of him
delivered
him
to the
jailers
until
that
he should pay
all
-
being owed
to him
Thus
also
the
Father
of Me
-
Heavenly
will do
to you
if
not
you forgive
each
the
brother
of him
from
the
heart
of you
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
the
words
these
He withdrew
from
-
Galilee
and
came
to
the
region
-
of Judea
beyond
the
Jordan
And
followed
Him
crowds
great
and
He healed
them
there
And
came
to Him
Pharisees
testing
Him
and
saying
If
is it lawful
to divorce
the
a wife
to him
for
every
cause
Which
now
answering
He said
Not
have you read
that
the [One]
having created
from [the]
beginning
male
and
female
made
them
and
said
On account of
this
will leave
a man
the
father
and
the
mother
and
be joined with
the
wife
of him
and
will become
the
two
into
flesh
one
so that
no longer
are they
two
but
flesh
one
What
therefore
-
God
united together
man
not
let separate
They say
to Him
Why
then
Moses
did command
to give
a roll
of divorce
and
to send away
He says
to them
-
Moses
in view of
the
hardness of heart
of you
allowed
you
to divorce
the
wives
of you
from [the]
beginning
however
not
was [it]
this way
I say
now
to you
that
whoever
-
shall divorce
-
wife
of him
except
for
sexual immorality
and
shall marry
another
commits adultery
Say
to Him
the
disciples
If
this
is
the
case
of the
man
with
the
wife
not
it is better
to marry
-
And
He said
to them
Not
all
receive
the
word
this
but only [those]
to whom
it has been given
There are
for
eunuchs
who
from [the]
womb
of [their] mother
were born
thus
and
there are
eunuchs
who
were made eunuchs
by
-
men
and
there are
eunuchs
who
made eunuchs of
themselves
for the sake of
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
The [one]
being able
to receive [it]
let him receive [it]
Then
were brought
to Him
little children
that
the
hands
He might lay
on them
and
He might pray
-
however
the disciples
rebuked
them
-
And
Jesus
said
Permit
the
little children
and
not
do forbid
them
to come
to
Me
of the
for
such kind
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
And
having laid
the
hands
upon them
He departed
from there
And
behold
one
having come
to Him
said
Teacher
what
good [thing]
shall I do
that
I might have
life
eternal
-
And
He said
to him
Why
Me
ask you
about
what is
good
Only One
is
-
good
If
however
you desire
into
-
life
to enter
keep
the
commandments
He says
to him
Which
-
And
Jesus
said
-
Not
shall you murder
not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
you shall honor
the
father
and
the
mother
and
you shall love
-
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
Says
to him
the
young man
Things
all these
I have kept
What
yet
lack I
Was saying
to him
-
Jesus
If
you desire
perfect
to be
go
sell
of you
the
possessing
and
give
poor
and
you will have
treasure
in
[the] heavens
and
come
follow
Me
Having heard
now
the
young man
the
statement
he went away
grieving
he was [one]
for
having
possessions
many
-
And
Jesus
said
to the
disciples
of Him
Truly
I say
to you
that
a rich man
with difficulty
will enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
Again
now
I say
to you
easier for
[it] is
a camel
through [the]
eye
of a needle
to go
than
a rich man
into
the
kingdom
of
God
Having heard
now
the
disciples
were astonished
exceedingly
saying
Who
then
is able
to be saved
Having looked on [them]
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
With
men
this
impossible
is
with
however
God
all things [are]
possible
Then
answering
-
Peter
said
to Him
Behold
we
left
all things
and
followed
You
what
then
will be
to us
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
you
-
having followed
Me
in
the
regeneration
when
shall sit down
the
Son
-
of Man
upon
[the] throne
of glory
of Him
will sit
also
you
on
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
-
of Israel
And
everyone
who
has left
houses
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
children
or
lands
for the sake of
-
My
name
a hundredfold
will receive
and
life
eternal
will inherit
Many
however
will be
first
last
and
last
first
Like
for
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to a man
a master of a house
who
went out
in [the]
morning
to hire
workmen
for
the
vineyard
of him
Having agreed
then
with
the
workmen
for
a denarius
for the
day
he sent
them
into
the
vineyard
of him
And
having gone out
about
the third
hour
he saw
others
standing
in
the
marketplace
idle
and
to them
he said
Go
also
you
into
the
vineyard
and
whatever
if
might be
right
I will give
you
-
And
they went
Again
then
having gone out
about [the]
sixth
and
ninth
hour
he did
likewise
About
then
the
eleventh
having gone out
he found
others
standing
and
he says
to them
Why
here
stand you
all
the
day
idle
They say
to him
Because
no one
us
has hired
He says
to them
Go
also
You
into
the
vineyard
Evening
then
having arrived
says
the
master
of the
vineyard
to
foreman
of him
Call
the
workmen
and
pay
the
wages
having begun
from
the
last
unto
the
first
having come
And
those [hired]
about
the
eleventh
hour
they received
each
a denarius
And
having come
the
first
they thought
that
more
they will receive
but
they received
those
each
a denarius
also
themselves
Having received
now
they were grumbling
against
the
master of the house
saying
These
the
last
one
hour
have worked
and
equal
them
to us
you have made
those
having borne
the
burden
of the
day
and
the
scorching heat
-
And
answering
to one
of them
he said
Friend
not
I do wrong
you
Not
for a denarius
did you agree with
me
Take
what [is]
yours
and
go
I desire
now
to this
-
last
to give
as
also
to you
not
is it lawful
for me
what
I will
to do
with
that which [is]
mine
Or
the
eye
of you
envious
is
because
I
generous
am
Thus
will be
the
last
first
and
the
first
last

And
going up
Jesus
to
Jerusalem
He took
the
twelve
aside
themselves
and
on
the
way
He said
to them
Behold
we go up
to
Jerusalem
and
the
Son
-
of Man
will be betrayed
to the
chief priests
and
scribes
and
they will condemn
Him
to
death
and
they will betray
Him
the
Gentiles
unto
-
to mock
and
to flog
and
to crucify
and
the
third
day
He will rise again
Then
came
to Him
the
mother
of the
sons
of Zebedee
with
the
sons
of her
kneeling down
and
asking
something
from
Him
-
And
He said
to her
What
do you desire
She says
to Him
Say
that
might sit
these
-
two
sons
of mine
one
on
[the] right hand
and
one
on
[the] left hand
of You
in
the
kingdom
of You
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
Not
you know
what
you ask for
Are you able
to drink
the
cup
which
I
am about
to drink
They say
to Him
We are able
He says
to them
-
Indeed
the cup
of Me
You will drink
-
but
to sit
on
[the] right hand
of Me
and
on
[the] left
not
is
Mine
this
to give
but [to those]
for whom
it has been prepared
by
the
Father
of Me
And
having heard [this]
the
ten
were indignant
about
the
two
brothers
-
And
Jesus
having called to [him]
them
said
You know
that
the
rulers
of the
Gentiles
exercise lordship over
them
and
the
great ones
exercise authority over
them
Not
thus
will it be
among
you
but
whoever
if
wishes
among
you
great
to become
he will be
your
servant
and
whoever
-
wishes
among
you
to be
first
he will be
your
slave
even as
the
Son
-
of Man
not
came
to be served
but
to serve
and
to give
the
life
of Him
[as] a ransom
for
many
And
[as] were going out
they
from
Jericho
followed
Him
a crowd
great
And
behold
two
blind [men]
sitting
beside
the
road
having heard
that
Jesus
is passing by
cried out
saying
Lord
Have mercy on
us
Son
of David
-
And
the crowd
rebuked
them
that
they should be silent
-
But
all the more
they cried out
saying
Lord
have mercy on
us
Son
of David
And
having stopped
-
Jesus
called
them
and
said
What
do you desire
I should do
unto you
They say
to Him
Lord
that
might be opened
the
eyes
of us
Having been moved with compassion
then
-
Jesus
touched
the
eyes
of them
and
immediately
they received sight
and
they followed
Him
And
when
they drew near
to
Jerusalem
and
came
to
Bethphage
on
the
Mount
-
of Olives
then
Jesus
sent
two
disciples
saying
to them
Go
into
the
village
-
in front
of you
and
immediately
you will find
a donkey
having been tied
and
a colt
with
her
having untied [them]
bring [them]
to Me
And
if
anyone
to you
says
anything
you will say
that
the
Lord
of them
need
has
Immediately
then
he will send
them
This
then
came to pass
that
it might be fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
the
prophet
saying
Say
to the
daughter
of Zion
Behold
the
King
of you
comes
to you
gentle
and
mounted
on
a donkey
even
upon
a colt
[the] foal
of a beast of burden
Having gone
then
the
disciples
and
having done
as
commanded
them
-
Jesus
they brought
the
donkey
and
the
colt
and
put
upon
them
their
cloaks
and
He sat
on
them
The
now
very great
crowd
spread
their
the
cloaks
on
the
road
others
now
were cutting down
branches
from
the
trees
and
were spreading [them]
on
the
road
The
now
crowds
-
going before
Him
and
those
following
were crying out
saying
Hosanna
to the
Son
of David
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
Hosanna
in
the
highest
And
having entered
of Him
into
Jerusalem
was stirred
all
the
city
saying
Who
is
this
-
And
the crowds
were saying
This
is
the
prophet
Jesus
the [One]
from
Nazareth
-
of Galilee
And
entered
Jesus
into
the
temple
and
cast out
all
those
selling
and
buying
in
the
temple
and
the
tables
of the
money changers
He overturned
and
the
seats
of those
selling
the
doves
And
He says
to them
It has been written
The
house
of Me
a house
of prayer
will be called
You
however
it
have made
a den
of robbers
And
came
to Him
blind
and
lame
in
the
temple
and
He healed
them
Having seen
now
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
the
wonders
that
He did
and
the
children
the
crying out
in
the
temple
and
saying
Hosanna
to the
Son
of David
they were indignant
and
said
to Him
Hear you
what
these
say
-
And
Jesus
says
to them
Yes
never
did you read
-
Out of [the]
mouth
of babes
and
sucklings
You have prepared for yourself
praise
And
having left
them
He went
out of
the
city
to
Bethany
and
He passed the night
there
In the morning
then
having come back
into
the
city
He became hungry
And
having seen
fig tree
one
along
the
road
He came
to
it
and
nothing
found
on
it
if
not
leaves
only
And
He says
to it
Never
no more
from
you
fruit
let there be
to
the
age
And
withered
immediately
the
fig tree
And
having seen [it]
the
disciples
marveled
saying
How
so quickly
withered
the
fig tree
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
if
you have
faith
and
not
do doubt
not
only
the [miracle]
of the
fig tree
will you do
but
even if
to the
mountain
this
you should say
Be you taken away
and
be you cast
into
the
sea
it will come to pass
And
all things
as many as
-
you might ask
in
-
prayer
believing
you will receive
And
having come
of Him
into
the
temple
came
to Him
teaching
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
people
saying
By
what
authority
these things
are You doing
And
who
to You
gave
the
authority
this
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
Will ask
you
I also
thing
one
which
if
you tell
Me
I also
to you
will say
by
what
authority
these things
I do
The
baptism
of
John
from where
was it
From
heaven
or
from
men
-
And
they were reasoning
with
themselves
saying
If
we should say
From
heaven
He will say
to us
Because of
why
then
not
did you believe
him
If
however
we should say
From
men
we fear
the
multitude
all
for
as
a prophet
hold
-
John
And
answering
-
Jesus
they said
Not
do we know
Said
to them
also
He
Neither
I
tell
you
by
what
authority
these things
I do
What
however
you
think
A man
had
sons
two
having come
to the
first
he said
Son
go
today
work
in
the
vineyard
-
And
answering
he said
will I
master
however
Not
he went
Having come
then
to the
second
he said
likewise
-
And
answering
he said
I [will]
sir
and
not
did he go
Which
of
the
two
did
the
will
of the
father
They say
The
first
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that
the
tax collectors
and
the
prostitutes
go before
you
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
Came
for
John
to
you
in [the]
way
of righteousness
and
not
you did believe
him
-
however
the tax collectors
and
the
prostitutes
believed
him
you
then
having seen
not even
did repent
afterward
-
to believe
him
Another
parable
hear
A man
there was
a master of a house
who
planted
a vineyard
and
a fence
it
placed around
and
dug
in
it
a winepress
and
built
a tower
and
rented out
it
to farmers
and
traveled abroad
When
then
drew near
the
season
of the
fruits
he sent
the
servants
of him
to
the
farmers
to receive
the
fruits
of him
And
having taken
the
farmers
the
servants
of him
one
-
they beat
one
then
they killed
one
then
they stoned
Again
he sent
other
servants
more
than the
first
and
they did
to them
likewise
Afterward
then
he sent
to
them
the
son
of him
saying
They will respect
the
son
of me
-
But
the farmers
having seen
the
son
said
among
themselves
This
is
the
heir
come
let us kill
him
and
gain possession of
the
inheritance
of him
And
having taking
him
they cast [him]
out of
the
vineyard
and
killed [him]
When
therefore
shall come
the
master
of the
vineyard
what
will he do
the
farmers
to those
They say
to him
[The] wretches
grievously
He will destroy
them
and
the
vineyard
he will rent out
to other
farmers
who
will give
to him
the
fruits
in
the
seasons
of them
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Never
did you read
in
the
Scriptures
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
building
this
has become
the
chief
corner
From
[the] Lord
was
this
and
it is
marvelous
in
[the] eyes
of us
Because of
this
I say
to you
that
will be taken away
from
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
it will be given
to a people
producing
the
fruits
of it
And
the [one]
having fallen
on
the
stone
this
will be broken
on
whomever
but
-
it shall fall
it will grind to powder
him
And
having heard
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
the
parables
of Him
they knew
that
about
them
He speaks
And
seeking
Him
to lay hold of
they feared
the
crowds
because
as
a prophet
Him
they were holding
And
answering
-
Jesus
again
spoke
in
parables
to them
saying
Has become like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to a man
a king
who
made
a wedding feast
for the
son
of him
And
he sent
the
servants
of him
to call
those
having been invited
to
the
wedding feast
and
not
they were willing
to come
Again
he sent
other
servants
saying
Say
to those
having been invited
Behold
the
dinner
of me
I have prepared
the
oxen
of Me
and
the
fatlings
have been killed
and
all things [are]
ready
come
to
the
wedding feast
-
And
having paid no attention
they went away
one
-
to
the
own
field
one
then
to
the
business
of him
-
And
the rest
having laid hold of
the
servants
of him
mistreated
and
killed [them]
-
And
the king
was angry
and
having sent
the
armies
of him
he destroyed
the
murderers
those
and
the
city
of them
he burned
Then
he says
to
servants
of him
The
indeed
wedding feast
ready
is
those
however
having been invited
not
were
worthy
Go
therefore
into
the
thoroughfares
of the
highways
and
as many as
if
you shall find
invite
to
the
wedding feast
And
having gone out
the
servants
those
into
the
highways
they brought together
all
as many as
they found
evil
both
and
good
and
became full
the
wedding hall
of those reclining
Having entered in
then
the
king
to see
those
reclining
he beheld
there
a man
not
being dressed
in clothes
of wedding
and
he says
to him
Friend
how
did you enter
here
not
having
garment
of wedding
-
And
he was speechless
Then
the
king
said
to the
servants
Having bound
his
feet
and
hands
cast out
him
into
the
darkness
-
outer
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
Many
for
are
called
few
however
chosen
Then
having gone out
the
Pharisees
counsel
took
how
Him
they might trap
in
His words
And
they send
to Him
the
disciples
of them
with
the
Herodians
saying
Teacher
we know
that
true
You are
and
the
way
-
of God
in
[the] truth
You teach
and
not
there is care
to You
about
no one
not
for
You look
on [the]
appearance
of men
Tell
therefore
us
what
You
think
Is it lawful
to give
tribute
to Caesar
or
not
Having known
however
-
Jesus
the
malice
of them
He said
Why
Me
do you test
hypocrites
Show
Me
the
coin
of the
tribute
-
And
they presented
to Him
a denarius
And
He says
to them
Whose [is]
the
likeness
this
And
whose
inscription
They say
Caesarâs
Then
He says
to them
Give back
therefore
the things
of Caesar
to Caesar
and
the things
-
of God
-
to God
And
having heard
they marveled
and
having left
Him
they went away
On
that
-
day
came
to Him
Sadducees
those saying
not
there is
a resurrection
and
they questioned
Him
saying
Teacher
Moses
said
If
anyone
should die
not
having
children
will marry
the
brother
of him
the
wife
of him
and
he will raise up
offspring
for the
brother
of him
There were
now
among
us
seven
brothers
and
the
first
having married
died
and
not
having
seed
he left
the
wife
of him
to the
brother
of him
Likewise
also
the
second
and
the
third
unto
the
seventh
Last
then
of all
died
the
woman
In
the
resurrection
therefore
of which
of the
seven
will she be
wife
All
for
had
her
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
You err
not
knowing
the
Scriptures
nor
the
power
-
of God
In
for
the
resurrection
neither
do they marry
nor
are given in marriage
but
like
angels
in
-
heaven
they are
Concerning
now
the
resurrection
of the
dead
not
have you read
that which
has been spoken
to you
by
-
God
saying
I
am
the
God
of Abraham
and
the
God
of Isaac
and
the
God
of Jacob
Not
He is
the
God
of [the] dead
but
of [the] living
And
having heard
the
crowds
were astonished
at
the
teaching
of Him
-
And
the Pharisees
having heard
that
He had silenced
the
Sadducees
were gathered
together
the
same
And
questioned [Him]
one
of
them
a lawyer
testing
Him
Teacher
which
commandment
[is the] greatest
in
the
law
-
And
He said
to him
You shall love
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
with
all
the
heart
of you
and
with
all
the
soul
of you
and
with
all
the
mind
of you
This
is
the
great
and
first
commandment
[The] second
[is] like
it
You shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
On
these
-
two
commandments
all
the
law
hangs
and
the
Prophets
Having been assembled together
now
the
Pharisees
questioned
them
-
Jesus
saying
What
you
think
concerning
the
Christ
Of whom
son
is He
They say
to Him
-
Of David
He says
to them
How
then
David
in
spirit
does call
Him
Lord
saying
Said
the Lord
to the
Lord
of me
Sit
on
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
the
enemies
of You
[as] a footstool
for the
feet
of You
If
therefore
David
calls
Him
Lord
how
son
of him
is He
And
no one
was able
to answer
Him
a word
nor
dared
anyone
from
that
-
day
to question
Him
no longer
Then
-
Jesus
spoke
to the
crowds
and
to
disciples
of Him
saying
On
-
Mosesâ
seat
have sat down
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
All things
therefore
how many
if
they might tell
you
keep
and
observe
After
however
the
works
of them
not
do
They speak
for
and
not
act
They tie up
-
burdens
heavy
and
lay [them]
on
the
shoulders
-
of men
themselves
however
with
finger
of them
not
are they willing
to move
them
All
now
the
deeds
of them
they do
in order
-
to be seen
-
by men
They broaden
for
the
phylacteries
of them
and
enlarge
their
tassels
They love
now
the
chief place
at
the
banquets
and
the
first seats
in
the
synagogues
and
the
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
to be called
by
-
men
Rabbi
You
however
not
shall be called
Rabbi
One
for
is
of you
the
Teacher
all
now
you
brothers
are
And
father
no [one]
call
of you
on
the
earth
One
for
is
of you
the
Father
who [is]
in heaven
Neither
be called
instructors
since
[the] instructor
of you
is
One
the
Christ
-
And
the greatest
among you
will be
your
servant
He who
then
shall exalt
himself
will be humbled
and
whoever
shall humble
himself
will be exalted
Woe
however
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you shut up
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
before
-
men
You
for
neither
enter
nor even
those who
are entering
do you allow
to go in
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you traverse
the
sea
and
the
dry [land]
to make
one
convert
and
when
he has become [so]
you make
him
a son
of hell
twofold more
than yourselves
Woe
to you
guides
blind
those
saying
Whoever
-
shall swear
by
the
temple
nothing
it is
whoever
however
-
shall swear
by
the
gold
of the
temple
is bound by his oath
Foolish
and
blind
Which
for
greater
is
the
gold
or
the
temple
-
having sanctified
the
gold
And [you say]
Whoever
-
shall swear
by
the
altar
nothing
it is
whoever
however
-
shall swear
by
the
gift
that [is]
upon
it
he is bound by his oath
You blind men
Which
for
[is] greater
the
gift
or
the
altar
-
sanctifying
the
gift
The [one]
therefore
having sworn
by
the
altar
swears
by
it
and
by
all things
that [are]
upon
it
And
the [one]
having sworn
by
the
temple
swears
by
it
and
by
the [One]
dwelling
in it
And
the [one]
having sworn
by
-
heaven
swears
by
the
throne
-
of God
and
by
the [One]
sitting
upon
it
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you pay tithes of
-
mint
and
-
dill
and
-
cummin
and
you have neglected
the
weightier [matters]
of the
law
-
justice
and
-
mercy
and
-
faithfulness
These
now
it behooved you
to do
those
not
to be leaving aside
Guides
blind
Those
straining out
the
gnat
the
however
camel
swallowing
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you cleanse
the
outside
of the
cup
and
of the
dish
inside
however
they are full
of
greed
and
self-indulgence
Pharisee
blind
Cleanse
first
the
inside
of the
cup
that
might become
also
the
outside
of them
clean
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you are like
tombs
having been whitewashed
which
outwardly
indeed
appear
beautiful
Inside
however
they are full
of bones
of [the] dead
and
of all
impurity
Thus
also
you
outwardly
indeed
appear
-
to men
righteous
inwardly
however
you are
full
of hypocrisy
and
lawlessness
Woe
to you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
For
you build
the
tombs
of the
prophets
and
adorn
the
monuments
of the
righteous
and
you say
If
we had lived
in
the
days
of the
fathers
of us
not
-
we would have been
with them
partakers
in
the
blood
of the
prophets
Thus
you bear witness
to yourselves
that
sons
you are
of those
having murdered
the
prophets
And
you
fill up
the
measure
of the
fathers
of you
Serpents
Offspring
of vipers
How
shall you escape
from
the
sentence
-
of hell
Because of
this
behold
I
send
to
you
prophets
and
wise [men]
and
scribes
Some of
them
you will kill
and
will crucify
and [some]
of
them
you will flog
in
the
synagogues
of you
and
will persecute
from
town
to
town
so that
shall come
upon
you
all [the]
blood
righteous
being poured out
upon
the
earth
from
the
blood
of Abel
the
righteous
to
the
blood
of Zechariah
son
of Berekiah
whom
you murdered
between
the
temple
and
the
altar
Truly
I say
to you
will come
these things
all
upon
the
generation
this
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
-
killing
the
prophets
and
stoning
those
having been sent
to
her
How often
would I
have gathered together
the
children
of you
in which
way
a hen
gathers together
the
chicks
of her
under
the
wings
and
not
you were willing
Behold
is left
to you
the
house
of you
I say
for
to you
no
not
Me
shall you see
from
now
until
-
you say
Blessed [is]
the [One]
coming
in [the]
name
of [the] Lord
And
having gone forth
-
Jesus
from
the
temple
He was going away
and
came to [Him]
the
disciples
of Him
to point out
to Him
the
buildings
of the
temple
-
And
answering
He said
to them
Not
do you see
these things
all
Truly
I say
to you
none
not even
shall be left
here
stone
upon
stone
which
not
will be thrown down
[As] was sitting
now
He
upon
the
Mount
-
of Olives
came to
Him
the
disciples
in
private
saying
Tell
us
when
these things
will be
And
what [is]
the
sign
-
of Your
coming
and
of the consummation
of the
age
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to them
Take heed
lest
anyone
you
mislead
Many
for
will come
in
the
name
of Me
saying
I
am
the
Christ
and
many
they will mislead
You will begin
then
to hear of
wars
and
rumors
of wars
Behold
not
be alarmed
it is necessary
for
to take place
but
not yet
is
the
end
Will rise up
for
nation
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
there will be
famines
and
earthquakes
in
[various] places
All
then
these [are]
[the] beginning
of birth pains
Then
will they deliver
you
to
tribulation
and
will kill
you
and
you will be
hated
by
all
the
nations
on account of
the
name
of Me
And
then
will fall away
many
and
one another
they will betray
and
will hate
one another
and
many
false prophets
will arise
and
will mislead
many
And
because
-
is to be multiplied
-
lawlessness
will grow cold
the
love
of the
many
The [one]
however
having endured
to [the]
end
he
will be saved
And
there will be proclaimed
this
-
gospel
of the
kingdom
in
all
the
earth
for
a testimony
to all
the
nations
and
then
will come
the
end
When
therefore
you shall see
the
abomination
-
of desolation
-
having been spoken of
by
Daniel
the
prophet
standing
in [the]
place
holy
the [one]
reading
let him understand
then
those
in
-
Judea
let them flee
to
the
mountains
the [one]
on
the
housetop
not
let him come down
to take
anything
out of
the
house
of him
and
the [one]
in
the
field
neither
let him return
back
to take
the
cloak
of him
Woe
then
to those
in
womb
having
and
to the [ones]
nursing infants
in
those
the
days
Pray
however
that
not
might be
the
flight
of you
in winter
nor
on a Sabbath
There will be
for
then
tribulation
great
such as
not
has been
from [the]
beginning
of [the] world
until
-
now
no
never
not
shall be
And
if
not
had been shortened
the
days
those
not
-
there would have been saved
any
flesh
because of
however
the
elect
will be shortened
the
days
those
Then
if
anyone
to you
says
Behold
here [is]
the
Christ
or
Here
not
believe [it]
There will arise
for
false Christs
and
false prophets
and
they will give
signs
great
and
wonders
so as
to mislead
if
possible
even
the
elect
Behold
I have foretold [it]
to you
If
therefore
they say
to you
Behold
in
the
wilderness
He is
not
go forth
[or] âBehold
in
the
inner rooms
not
believe [it]
Just as
for
the
lightning
comes forth
from [the]
east
and
shines
as far as [the]
west
so
will be
the
coming
of the
Son
-
of Man
For wherever
if
may be
the
carcass
there
will be gathered
the
vultures
Immediately
then
after
the
tribulation
the
days
of those
The
sun
will be darkened
and
the
moon
not
will give
the
light
of it
and
the
stars
will fall
from
the
sky
and
the
powers
of the
heavens
will be shaken
And
then
will appear
the
sign
of the
Son
-
of Man
in
heaven
and
then
will mourn
all
the
tribes
of the
earth
and
they will see
the
Son
-
of Man
coming
on
the
clouds
-
of heaven
with
power
and
glory
great
And
He will send
the
angels
of Him
with
a trumpet call
great
and
they will gather together
the
elect
of Him
from
the
four
winds
from
[the] ends
of the heavens
to
ends
of them
Of
now
the
fig tree
learn
the
parable
When
already
the
branch
of it
may have become
tender
and
the
leaves
it puts forth
you know
that
near [is]
the
summer
Thus
also
you
when
you see
all
these things
know
that
near
He is
at
[the] doors
Truly
I say
to you
that
no
not
will have passed away
the
generation
this
until
-
all
these things
shall have taken place
The
heaven
and
the
earth
will pass away
-
but
the words
of Me
no
not
shall pass away
Concerning
however
the
day
that
and
hour
no one
knows
not even
the
angels
of the
heavens
nor
the
Son
if
not
the
Father
only
As [were]
for
the
days
-
of Noah
so
will be
the
coming
of the
Son
-
of Man
As
for
they were
in
the
days
those
-
before
the
flood
eating
and
drinking
marrying
and
giving in marriage
until
that
day
entered
Noah
into
the
ark
And
not
they knew
until
came
the
flood
and
took away
all
thus
will be
also
the
coming
of the
Son
-
of Man
Then
will be
two
in
the
field
one
is taken
and
one
is left
Two [women]
will be grinding
at
the
mill
one
is taken
and
one
is left
Keep watch
therefore
for
not
you know
on what
day
the
Lord
of you
comes
This
then
know
that
if
had known
the
master of the house
in what
time of night
the
thief
comes
he would have watched
-
and
not
-
have allowed
to be broken into
the
house
of him
Because of
this
also
you
be
ready
for
in that
not
you expect
hour
the
Son
-
of Man
comes
Who
then
is
the
faithful
servant
and
wise
whom
has set
the
master
over
the
household
of him
-
to give
to them
the
food
in
season
Blessed [is]
the
servant
that
whom
having come
the
master
of him
will find
thus
doing
Truly
I say
to you
that
over
all
the
possessing
of him
he will set
him
If
however
should say
the
evil
servant
that
in
the
heart
of him
Delays
of Me
the
master
and
should begin
to beat
the
fellow servants
of him
to eat
then
and
to drink
with
those
being drunkards
will come
the
master
the
servant
of that
in
a day
in which
not
he does expect
and
in
an hour
which
not
he is aware
and
will cut in pieces
him
and
the
place
of him
with
the
hypocrites
will appoint
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
teeth
Then
will be likened
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to ten
virgins
who
having taken
the
lamps
of them
went forth
to
meet
the
bridegroom
Five
now
of
them
were
foolish
and
five
wise
The
for
foolish
having taken
the
lamps
not
did take
with
them
oil
-
but
the wise
took
oil
in
the
vessels
with
the
lamps
of them
Tarrying
then
the
bridegroom
they became drowsy
all
and
were sleeping
At middle
then
of [the] night
a cry
there was
Behold
the
bridegroom
Go forth
to
meet
Then
arose
all
the
virgins
those
and
trimmed
the
lamps
of them
-
And
the foolish
to the
wise
said
Give
us
of
the
oil
of you
for
the
lamps
of us
are going out
Answered
then
the
wise
saying
Lest
-
no
not even
it might suffice
for us
and
you
Go
rather
to
those
selling
and
buy
for yourselves
[While] are going away
then
they
to buy
came
the
bridegroom
and
those
ready
went in
with
him
to
the
wedding feast
and
was shut
the
door
Afterward
then
come
also
the
other
virgins
saying
Lord
Lord
open
to us
-
And
answering
he said
Truly
I say
to you
not
I do know
you
Watch
therefore
for
neither
do you know
the
day
nor
the
hour
[It is] like
for
a man
going on a journey
[who] called
the
own
servants
and
delivered
to them
the
possessing
of him
And
to one
indeed
he gave
five
talents
to one
then
two
to one
then
one
to each
according to
the
own
ability
and
he left the region
immediately
Having gone
the [one]
the
five
talents
having received
traded
with
them
and
made
more
five
Likewise
the [one with]
the
two
gained
more
two
The [one]
however
-
one
having received
having gone away
dug in
the ground
and
hid
the
money
of the
master
of him
After
then
much
time
comes
the
master
of the
servants
those
and
takes
account
with
them
And
having come
the [one]
the
five
talents
having received
brought to [him]
other
five
talents
saying
Master
five
talents
to me
you did deliver
Behold
more
five
talents
have I gained
Said
to him
the
master
of Him
Well done
servant
good
and
faithful
Over
a few things
you were
faithful
over
many things
you
will I set
Enter
into
the
joy
of the
master
of you
Having come
also
the [one]
with the
two
talents
he said
Master
two
talents
to me
you did deliver
Behold
more
two
talents
have I gained
Said
to him
the
master
of Him
Well done
servant
good
and
faithful
Over
a few things
you were
faithful
over
many things
you
will I set
Enter
into
the
joy
of the
master
of you
Having come
then
also
the [one]
the
one
talent
having received
he said
Master
I knew
you
that
hard
you are
a man
reaping
where
not
you did sow
and
gathering
from where
not
you did scatter
And
having been afraid
having gone away
I hid
the
talent
of you
in
the
ground
Behold
you have
what [is]
yours
Answering
now
the
master
of him
said
to him
Wicked
servant
and
lazy
You knew
that
I reap
where
not
I sowed
and
gather
from where
not
I scattered
It behooved
you
therefore
to put
the
money
of me
to the
bankers
and
having come
I
would have received
-
-
my own
with
interest
Take
therefore
from
him
the
talent
and
give [it]
to the [one]
having
the
ten
talents
-
For
having
to everyone
will be given
and
he will have in abundance
the [one]
however
not
having
even
that which
he has
will be taken away
from
him
And
the
worthless
servant
cast out
into
the
darkness
-
outer
there
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
When
then
comes
the
Son
-
of Man
in
the
glory
of Him
and
all
the
angels
with
Him
then
He will sit
upon [the]
throne
of glory
of Him
And
will be gathered
before
Him
all
the
nations
and
He will separate
them
from
one another
as
the
shepherd
separates
the
sheep
from
the
goats
And
He will set
-
indeed
the sheep
on
[the] right hand
of Him
-
and
the goats
on
[the] left
Then
will say
the
King
to those
on
[the] right hand
of Him
Come
those
being blessed
of the
Father
of me
inherit
the
having been prepared
for you
kingdom
from [the]
foundation
of [the] world
I hungered
for
and
you gave
Me
to eat
I thirsted
and
you gave to drink
me
a stranger
I was
and
you took in
Me
naked
and
you clothed
Me
I was sick
and
you visited
Me
in
prison
I was
and
you came
to
Me
Then
will answer
Him
the
righteous
saying
Lord
when
You
saw we
hungering
and
fed [You]
Or
thirsting
and
gave [You] to drink
When
now
You
saw we
a stranger
and
took [You] in
Or
naked
and
clothed [You]
When
now
You
saw we
ailing
or
in
prison
and
came
to
You
And
answering
the
King
will say
to them
Truly
I say
to you
to the extent
as much as
you did [it]
to one
of these
the
brothers
of Me
the
least
to Me
you did [it]
Then
will He say
also
to those
on
[the] left
Depart
from
Me
being cursed
into
the
fire
-
eternal
-
having been prepared
for the
devil
and
the
angels
of him
I hungered
for
and
nothing
you gave
to Me
to eat
I thirsted
and
nothing
You gave to drink
Me
a stranger
I was
and
not
You took in
Me
naked
and
not
you did clothe
Me
sick
and
in
prison
and
not
did you visit
Me
Then
will answer
also
themselves
saying
Lord
when
You
saw we
hungering
or
thirsting
or
a stranger
or
naked
or
sick
or
in
prison
and
not
did minister
to You
Then
will He answer
them
saying
Truly
I say
to you
to the extent
that
not
you did [it]
to one
of these
the
least
neither
to Me
did you
And
will go away
these
into
punishment
eternal
-
but
the righteous
into
life
eternal
And
it came to pass
when
had finished
-
Jesus
all
the
words
these
He said
to the
disciples
of Him
You know
that
after
two
days
the
Passover
takes place
and
the
Son
-
of Man
is delivered
over
-
to be crucified
Then
were gathered together
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
people
in
the
courtyard
of the
high priest
who
is called
Caiaphas
and
they plotted together
in order that
-
Jesus
by guile
they might seize
and
kill
They were saying
however
Not
during
the
feast
that
not
a riot
there be
among
the
people
-
And
of Jesus
having been
in
Bethany
in [the]
house
of Simon
the
leper
came
to Him
a woman
having
an alabaster flask
fragrant oil
very costly
and
poured [it]
on
the
head
of Him
[as] He is reclining
Having seen
then
the
disciples
became indignant
saying
For what
purpose
[is] the
waste
this
Could
for
this
have been sold
for much
and
have been given
to [the] poor
Having known [this]
now
-
Jesus
said
to them
Why
trouble
do you cause
to the
woman
A work
for
beautiful
she did
to
Me
Always
for
the
poor
you have
with
you
Me
however
not
always
you have
In pouring
for
this [woman]
the
fragrant oil
this
on
the
body
of Me
for
the
burial
of Me
she did [it]
Truly
I say
to you
wherever
if
shall be proclaimed
the
gospel
this
in
all
the
world
will be spoken of
also
that which
did
this [woman]
for
a memorial
of her
Then
having gone
one
of the
Twelve
the [one]
being called
Judas
Iscariot
to
the
chief priests
he said
What
are you willing
me
to give
and I
to you
will betray
Him
-
And
they appointed
to him
thirty
pieces of silver
And
from
that time
he was seeking
an opportunity
that
Him
he might betray
On the
now
first [day]
of the
unleavened [bread]
came
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
saying
Where
wish you [that]
we should prepare
for You
to eat
the
Passover
-
And
He said
Go
into
the
city
unto
a
certain man
and
tell
him
the
Teacher
says
The
time
of Me
near
is
with
you
I will keep
the
Passover
with
the
disciples
of Me
And
did
the
disciples
as
directed
them
-
Jesus
and
prepared
the
Passover
Evening
now
having arrived
He was reclining
with
the
twelve
disciples
And [as]
they were eating
to them
He said
Truly
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
Me
And
being grieved
exceedingly
they began
to say
to Him
one
each
Not
I
is it
Lord
-
And
answering
He said
The [one]
having dipped
with
Me
the
hand
in
the
dish
he
Me
will betray
-
Indeed
the Son
-
of Man
goes
as
it has been written
about
Him
woe
however
-
the man
to that
by
whom
the
Son
-
of Man
is betrayed
Better
would it be
for him
if
not
had been born
the
man
that
Answering
now
Judas
who
was betraying
Him
said
Not
I
is it
Rabbi
He says
to him
You
have said
[As] they were eating
now
of them
having taken
-
Jesus
bread
and
having blessed
broke [it]
and
having given
to the
disciples
He said
Take
eat
this
is
the
body
of Me
And
having taken
a cup
and
having given thanks
He gave [it]
to them
saying
Drink
of
it
all of you
This
for
is
the
blood
of Me
of the
covenant
-
for
many
being poured out
for
forgiveness
of sins
I say
now
to you
no
not
will I drink
from
now
of
this
the
fruit
of the
vine
until
the
day
that
when
it
I drink
with
you
anew
in
the
kingdom
of the
Father
of Me
And
having sung a hymn
they went out
to
the
Mount
-
of Olives
Then
says
to them
-
Jesus
All
you
will fall away
because of
Me
during
the
night
this
It has been written
for
I will strike
the
shepherd
and
will be scattered
the
sheep
of the
flock
After
however
-
being raised
I
will go before
you
into
-
Galilee
Answering
now
-
Peter
said
to Him
If
all
will fall away
because of
You
I
never
will fall away
Said
to him
-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that
during
this
-
night
before [the]
rooster
crowing
three times
you will deny
Me
Says
to Him
-
Peter
Even if
it were necessary for
me
with
You
to die
no
not
You
will I deny
Likewise
also
all
the
disciples
said
Then
comes
with
them
-
Jesus
to
a place
called
Gethsemane
and
He says
to the
disciples
Sit
here
until
that
having gone away
over there
I shall pray
And
having taken with [Him]
-
Peter
and
the
two
sons
of Zebedee
He began
to be sorrowful
and
deeply distressed
Then
He says
to them
Very sorrowful
is
the
soul
of Me
even to
death
remain
here
and
watch
with
Me
And
having gone forward
a little
He fell
upon
face
of Him
praying
and
saying
Father
of Me
if
possible
it is
let pass
from
Me
the
cup
this
Nevertheless
not
as
I
will
but
as
You
And
He comes
to
the
disciples
and
finds
them
sleeping
And
He says
-
to Peter
Thus
not
were you able
one
hour
to watch
with
Me
Watch
and
pray
that
not
you enter
into
temptation
The
indeed
spirit
[is] willing
-
but
the flesh
weak
Again
for
a second time
having gone away
He prayed
saying
Father
of Me
if
not
is possible
this
to pass
if
not
it
I drink
be done
the
will
of You
And
having come
again
He finds
them
sleeping
were
for
of them
the
eyes
heavy
And
having left
them
again
having gone away
He prayed
for
[the] third time
the
same
thing
having said
again
Then
He comes
to
the
disciples
and
says
to them
Sleep
later on
and
take your rest
Behold
has drawn near
the
hour
and
the
Son
-
of Man
is betrayed
into
[the] hands
of sinners
Rise up
let us go
Behold
has drawn near
he who
is betraying
Me
And
yet
of Him
as He is speaking
behold
Judas
one
of the
Twelve
came
and
with
him
a crowd
great
with
swords
and
clubs
from
the
chief priests
and
elders
of the
people
The [one]
then
betraying
Him
gave
them
a sign
saying
Whomever
-
I shall kiss
He
it is
seize
Him
And
immediately
having come up
-
to Jesus
he said
Greetings
Rabbi
and
kissed
Him
-
And
Jesus
said
to him
Friend
for
what
are you come
Then
having come to [him]
they laid
-
hands
on
-
Jesus
and
seized
Him
And
behold
one
of those
with
Jesus
having stretched out
the
hand
drew
the
sword
of him
and
having struck
the
servant
of the
high priest
cut off
of him
the
ear
Then
says
to him
-
Jesus
Return
the
sword
of you
into
the
place
of it
all
for
those
having taken
[the] sword
by
[the] sword
will perish
Or
think you
that
not
I am able
to call upon
the
Father
of Me
and
He will furnish
to Me
presently
more than
twelve
legions
of angels
How
then
should be fulfilled
the
Scriptures
that
so
it must
be
In
that
-
hour
said
-
Jesus
to the
crowds
As
against
a robber
did you come out
with
swords
and
clubs
to capture
Me
Every
day
in
the
temple
I was sitting
teaching
and
not
you did seize
Me
This
then
all
is come to pass
that
might be fulfilled
the
Scriptures
of the
prophets
Then
the
disciples
all
having forsaken
Him
fled
Those
then
having seized
-
Jesus
led [Him] away
to
Caiaphas
the
high priest
where
the
scribes
and
the
elders
were assembled
-
And
Peter
was following
Him
from
afar
even
to the
court
of the
high priest
And
having entered
within
he was sitting
with
the
guards
to see
the
outcome
-
And
the chief priests
and
the
Council
whole
were seeking
false testimony
against
-
Jesus
so that
him
they might put to death
but
not any
they found
of many
having come forward as
false witnesses
At last
then
having come forward
two
they said
This [man]
has been saying
I am able
to destroy
the
temple
-
of God
and
in
three
days
to rebuild it
And
having stood up
the
high priest
said
to Him
Nothing
answer you
What
these
you
do witness against
-
And
Jesus
was silent
And
the
high priest
said
to Him
I adjure
you
by
-
God
the
living
that
us
You tell
if
You
are
the
Christ
the
Son
-
of God
Says
to him
-
Jesus
You
have said
But
I say
to you
from
now
you will see
the
Son
-
of Man
sitting
at
[the] right hand
-
of Power
and
coming
upon
the
clouds
-
of heaven
Then
the
high priest
tears
the
garments
of him
saying
He has blasphemed
why
any more
need
have we
of witnesses
Behold
now
you have heard
the
blasphemy
What
you
do think
-
And
answering
they said
Deserving
of death
He is
Then
they spat
in
the
face
of Him
and
struck
Him
Others
then
slapped [Him]
saying
Prophesy
to us
Christ
who
is
the [one]
having struck
You
-
And
Peter
was sitting
outside
in
the
court
and
came
to him
one
servant girl
saying
Also
You
were
with
Jesus
the
Galilean
-
And
he denied
before
all
saying
Not
I know
what
you say
Having gone out
then
to
the
porch
saw
him
another [servant girl]
and
says
to those
there
This [man]
was
with
Jesus
of
Nazareth
And
again
he denied
with
an oath
-
Not
I know
the
man
After
a little while
also
having come to [him]
those
standing by
they said
-
to Peter
Surely
also
you
of
them
are
even
for
the
speech
of you
away
you
gives
Then
he began
to curse
and
to swear
-
Not
I know
the
man
And
immediately
a rooster
crowed
And
remembered
-
Peter
the
word
of Jesus
He having said
-
Before [the]
rooster
crowing
three times
you will deny
Me
And
having gone
out
he wept
bitterly
Morning
then
having arrived
counsel
took
all
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
people
against
-
Jesus
so that
they might put to death
him
And
having bound
Him
they led away [Him]
and
delivered Him to
Pilate
the
governor
Then
having seen
Judas
the [one]
having delivered up
Him
that
He was condemned
having regretted [it]
he returned
the
thirty
pieces of silver
to the
chief priests
and
elders
saying
I sinned
having betrayed
blood
innocent
-
Then
they said
What [is that]
to
us
You
will see
And
having cast down
the
pieces of silver
into
the
temple
he withdrew
and
having gone away
hanged himself
-
And
the chief priests
having taken
the
pieces of silver
said
Not
it is lawful
to put
them
into
the
treasury
since [the]
price
of blood
it is
Counsel
then
having taken
they bought
with
them
the
field
of the
potter
for
a burial place
for the
strangers
Therefore
was called
the
field
that
Field
of Blood
to
-
this day
Then
was fulfilled
that
having been spoken
by
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
And
they took
the
thirty
pieces of silver
the
price
of the [One]
having been priced
whom
they set a price on
by [the]
sons
of Israel
and
they gave
them
for
the
field
of the
potter
as
directed
me
[the] Lord
-
And
Jesus
stood
before
the
governor
and
questioned
Him
the
governor
saying
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
-
And
Jesus
said
You
say
And
in
-
being accused
His
by
the
chief priests
and
elders
nothing
He answered
Then
says
to Him
-
Pilate
Not
do you hear
how many things
You
they witness against
And
not
He did answer
him
to
not even
one
word
so as
to amaze
the
governor
exceedingly
At
now
[the] feast
was accustomed
the
governor
to release
one
to the
multitude
prisoner
whom
they were wishing
They were holding
now
at that time
a prisoner
notable
called
Barabbas
Being gathered together
therefore
of them
said
to them
-
Pilate
Whom
will you [that]
I shall release
to you
Barabbas
or
Jesus
who
is called
Christ
He knew
for
that
through
envy
they delivered up
him
As was sitting
now
he
on
the
judgment seat
sent
to
him
the
wife
of him
saying
[Let there be] nothing
between you
and
the
righteous [man]
that
many things
for
I suffered
today
in
a dream
because of
Him
-
And
the chief priests
and
the
elders
persuaded
the
crowds
that
they should ask for
-
Barabbas
-
and
Jesus
should destroy
Answering
now
the
governor
said
to them
Which
do you desire
of
the
two
I release
to you
-
And
they said
-
Barabbas
Says
to them
-
Pilate
What
then
should I do with
Jesus
who
is called
Christ
They say
all
Let [Him] be crucified
-
And
he said
What
for
evil
did He commit
-
And
all the more
they kept crying out
saying
Let [Him] be crucified
Having seen
now
-
Pilate
that
nothing
it availed
but
rather
a riot
is arising
having taken
water
he washed
the
hands
before
the
crowd
saying
Guiltless
I am
of
the
blood
of this
For yourselves
you will see
And
answering
all
the
people
said
The
blood
of Him
[be] on
us
and
on
the
children
of us
Then
he released
to them
-
Barabbas
-
and
Jesus
having flogged
He delivered up [Him]
that
He might be crucified
Then
the
soldiers
of the
governor
having taken with [them]
-
Jesus
to
the
Praetorium
gathered
before
Him
all
the
cohort
And
having stripped
Him
a robe
scarlet
they put around
Him
And
having twisted together
a crown
of
thorns
they put [it]
on
the
head
of Him
and
a reed
in
the
right hand
of Him
and
having bowed the knees
before
Him
they mocked
Him
saying
Hail
King
of the
Jews
And
having spit
upon
Him
they took
the
reed
and
kept striking [Him]
on
the
head
of Him
And
when
they had mocked
Him
they took off
Him
the
robe
and
they put on
Him
the
garments
of Him
and
led away
Him
to
-
crucify [Him]
Going forth
now
they found
a man
of Cyrene
named
Simon
Him
they compelled
that
he might carry
the
cross
of Him
And
having come
to
a place
called
Golgotha
which
is
of a Skull
Place
called
they gave
Him
to drink
wine
with
gall
mingled
and
having tasted
not
He was willing
to drink [it]
Having crucified
now
Him
they divided
the
garments
of Him
casting
lots
And
sitting down
they were guarding
Him
there
And
they put up
over
the
head
of Him
the
accusation
of Him
written
This
is
Jesus
the
King
of the
Jews
At the same time
are crucified
with
Him
two
robbers
one
at [the]
right hand
and
one
at [the]
left
Those
now
passing by
kept railing at
Him
wagging
the
heads
of them
and
saying
The [One]
destroying
the
temple
and
in
three
days
building [it]
save
Yourself
If
[the] Son
You are
-
of God
also
descend
from
the
cross
Likewise
the
chief priests
mocking
with
the
scribes
and
elders
were saying
Others
He saved
Himself
not
is He able
to save
King
of Israel
He is
Let Him descend
now
from
the
cross
and
we will believe
in
Him
He trusted
on
-
God
Let Him deliver
now
if
He wants
Him
He said
for
-
Of God
I am
[the] Son
-
And
likewise
even
the
robbers
those
having been crucified
with
Him
were upbraiding
Him
From
then
[the] sixth
hour
darkness
was
over
all
the
land
until
[the] hour
ninth
About
then
the
ninth
hour
cried out
-
Jesus
in a voice
loud
saying
Eli
Eli
lema
sabachthani
That
is
God
of Me
God
of Me
so that
why
Me
have you forsaken
Some
then
of those who
there
were standing
having heard
began saying
-
Elijah
calls
this [man]
And
immediately
having run
one
of
them
and
having taken
a sponge
having filled [it]
and
with vinegar
and
having put [it] on
a reed
gave to drink
Him
-
And
the rest
were saying
Let be
Let us see
whether
comes
Elijah
to save
Him
-
And
Jesus
again
having cried
in a voice
loud
yielded up
[His]
spirit
And
behold
the
veil
of the
temple
was torn
from
top
to
bottom
into
two
and
the
earth
was shaken
and
the
rocks
were split
and
the
tombs
were opened
and
many
bodies
of the
having fallen asleep
saints
arose
and
having gone forth
out of
the
tombs
after
the
resurrection
of Him
they entered
into
the
holy
city
and
appeared
to many
-
And
the centurion
and
those
with
him
keeping guard over
-
Jesus
having seen
the
earthquake
and
the things
taking place
feared
greatly
saying
Truly
Godâs
Son
was
this
They were
now
there
women
many
from
afar off
looking on
who
followed
-
Jesus
from
-
Galilee
ministering
to Him
among
whom
was
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
Mary
the
-
of James
and
Joseph
mother
and
the
mother
of the
sons
of Zebedee
Evening
now
having arrived
came
a man
rich
from
Arimathea
named
Joseph
who
also
himself
was discipled
-
to Jesus
He
having gone
-
to Pilate
asked for
the
body
-
of Jesus
Then
-
Pilate
commanded it
to be given up
And
having taken
the
body
-
Joseph
wrapped
it
in
a linen cloth
clean
and
placed
it
in
the
new
of him
tomb
which
he had cut
in
the
rock
and
having rolled
a stone
great
to the
door
of the
tomb
he went away
Was
now
there
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
the
other
Mary
sitting
opposite
the
tomb
-
And
the next day
which
is
after
the
Preparation
were gathered together
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
before
Pilate
saying
Sir
we have remembered
how
that
-
deceiver
said
while
living
After
three
days
I arise
Command
therefore
to be secured
the
tomb
until
the
third
day
lest
ever
having come
the
disciples
steal away
him
and
say
to the
people
He is risen
from
the
dead
And
will be
the
last
deception
worse
than the
first
Said
to them
-
Pilate
You have
a guard
Go
make [it as] secure
as
you know [how]
-
And
having gone
they made secure
the
tomb
having sealed
the
stone
with
the
guard
After
then
[the] Sabbaths
it
being dawn
toward
[the] first [day]
of [the] week
came
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
the
other
Mary
to see
the
tomb
And
behold
an earthquake
there was
great
an angel
for
of [the] Lord
having descended
out of
heaven
and
having come
rolled away
the
stone
and
was sitting
upon
it
Was
now
the
appearance
of him
like
lightning
and
the
clothing
of him
white
as
snow
From
now
the
fear
of him
trembled
those
keeping guard
and
became
as
dead [men]
Answering
now
the
angel
said
to the
women
Not
fear
you
I know
for
that
Jesus
the [One]
having been crucified
you seek
Not
He is
here
He is risen
for
as
He said
Come
see
the
place
where
He was lying
And
quickly
having gone
say
to the
disciples
of Him
that
He is risen
from
the
dead
and
behold
He goes before
you
into
-
Galilee
there
Him
you will see
Behold
I have told
you
And
having gone out
quickly
from
the
tomb
with
fear
and
joy
great
they ran
to tell
the
disciples
of Him
And
behold
Jesus
met
them
saying
Greetings
-
And
having come to [Him]
they took hold of
His
-
feet
and
worshiped
Him
Then
says
to them
-
Jesus
Not
fear
Go
tell
the
brothers
of Me
so that
they should go
into
-
Galilee
and there
Me
will they see
[As] were going
now
they
behold
some
of the
guard
having gone
into
the
city
reported
to the
chief priests
all
the things
having been done
And
having been gathered together
with
the
elders
counsel
then
having taken
silver pieces
many
they gave
to the
soldiers
saying
Say
that
the
disciples
of Him
by night
having come
stole
Him
we
being asleep
And
if
is heard
this
by
the
governor
we
will persuade
and
you
out of trouble
will keep
-
And
having taken
money
they did
as
they were instructed
And
is spread abroad
the
report
this
among [the]
Jews
until
the
present
day
-
And
the eleven
disciples
went
into
-
Galilee
to
the
mountain
where
assigned
them
-
Jesus
And
having seen
Him
they worshiped
some
however
doubted
And
having come to [them]
-
Jesus
spoke
to them
saying
Has been given
to Me
all
authority
in
heaven
and
on
the
earth
Having gone
therefore
disciple
all
the
nations
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of the
Father
and
of the
Son
and
of the
Holy
Spirit
teaching
them
to observe
all things
whatever
I commanded
you
And
behold
I
with
you
am
all
the
days
until
the
completion
of the
age
[The] beginning
of the
gospel
of Jesus
Christ
Son
of God
As
it has been written
in
-
Isaiah
the
prophet
Behold
I send
the
messenger
of Me
before
face
of You
who
will prepare
the
way
of You
[The] voice
of one crying
in
the
wilderness
Prepare
the
way
of [the] Lord
straight
make
the
paths
of Him
Came
John
-
baptizing
in
the
wilderness
proclaiming
[a] baptism
of repentance
for
forgiveness
of sins
And
were going out
to
him
all
the
of Judea
region
and
-
of Jerusalem
all
and
were being baptized
by
him
in
the
Jordan
river
confessing
the
sins
of them
And
was
-
John
clothed in
hair
of a camel
and
a belt
of leather
around
the
waist
of him
and
he is eating
locusts
and
honey
wild
And
he was preaching
saying
He comes
who
[is] mightier
than I
after
me
of whom
not
I am
sufficient
having stooped down
to untie
the
strap
of the
sandals
of Him
I
baptized
you
with water
He
however
will baptize
you
[the] Spirit
Holy
And
it came to pass
in
those
-
days
[that] came
Jesus
from
Nazareth
-
of Galilee
and
was baptized
in
the
Jordan
by
John
And
immediately
going up
from
the
water
he saw
tearing open
the
heavens
and
the
Spirit
as
a dove
descending
upon
Him
And
a voice
came
out of
the
heavens
You
are
the
Son
of Me
the
beloved
in
You
I am well pleased
And
immediately
the
Spirit
Him
drives out
into
the
wilderness
And
He was
in
the
wilderness
forty
days
being tempted
by
-
Satan
And
He was
with
the
wild animals
and
the
angels
were ministering
to Him
And
after
the
delivering up
-
of John
came
-
Jesus
into
-
Galilee
proclaiming
the
gospel
-
of God
and
saying
-
Has been fulfilled
the
time
and
has drawn near
the
kingdom
-
of God
repent
and
believe
in
the
gospel
And
passing
by
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
He saw
Simon
and
Andrew
the
brother
of Simon
casting a net
into
the
sea
they were
for
fishermen
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
Come
after
Me
and
I will make
you
to become
fishers
of men
And
immediately
having left
the
nets
they followed
Him
And
having gone on
a little
He saw
James
the [son]
-
of Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
of him
and
they
[were] in
the
boat
adjusting
the
nets
And
immediately
He called
them
and
having left
the
father
of them
Zebedee
in
the
boat
with
the
hired servants
they went away
after
Him
And
they go
into
Capernaum
and
immediately
on the
Sabbaths
having entered
into
the
synagogue
He was teaching
And
they were astonished
at
the
teaching
of Him
He was
for
teaching
them
as
authority
having
and
not
as
the
scribes
And
immediately
there was
in
the
synagogue
of them
a man
with
a spirit
unclean
and
he cried out
saying
What
to us
and
to You
Jesus
of Nazareth
Did You come
to destroy
us
I know
You
who
are
the
Holy [One]
-
of God
And
rebuked
him
-
Jesus
Be silent
and
come forth
out of
him
And
having thrown into convulsions
him
the
spirit
-
unclean
and
having cried
in a voice
loud
it came forth
out of
him
And
were astonished
all
so as
to question
themselves
saying
What
is
this
teaching
new
With
authority
even
the
spirits
-
unclean
He commands
and
they obey
Him
And
went out
the
news
of Him
immediately
everywhere
into
all
the
surrounding region
-
of Galilee
And
immediately
out of
the
synagogue
having gone forth
they came
into
the
house
of Simon
and
Andrew
with
James
and
John
-
and
the mother-in-law
of Simon
was laying sick
fevering
And
immediately
they speak
to Him
about
her
And
having come to [her]
He raised up
her
having taken hold
of the
hand
And
left
her
the
fever
and
she began to minister
to them
Evening
now
having come
when
went down
the
sun
they began bringing
to
Him
all
those
sick
being
and
those
being possessed by demons
And
was
all
the
city
gathered together
at
the
door
And
He healed
many
sick
being
of various
diseases
and
demons
many
He cast out
And
not
He would allow
to speak
the
demons
because
they knew
Him
And
very early
in night
still much
having risen up
He went out
and
departed
into
solitary
a place
and there
He was praying
And
went after
Him
Simon
and
those
with
him
and
having found
Him
also
they say
to Him
-
Everyone
seeks
You
And
He says
to them
Let us go
another way
into
the
neighboring
towns
so that
also
there
I might preach
for
this
therefore
have I come forth
And
He was going
preaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
in
all
-
Galilee
and
-
demons
casting out
And
comes
to
Him
a leper
imploring
Him
and
kneeling down to Him
saying
to Him
-
If
You are willing
You are able
me
to cleanse
And
having been moved with compassion
having stretched out
the
hand
of Him
He touched him
and
says
to him
I am willing
be you cleansed
And
immediately
departed
from
him
the
leprosy
and
he was cleansed
And
having sternly warned
him
immediately
He sent away
him
And
He says
to him
See [that]
nothing
to none
you speak
But
go
yourself
show
to the
priest
and
offer
for
the
cleansing
of you
what
commanded
Moses
for
a testimony
to them
-
And
having gone out
he began
to proclaim
much
and
to spread abroad
the
matter
so that
no longer
He
was able
openly
into [the]
city
to enter
but
out
in
solitary
places
He was
and
they were coming
to
Him
from every quarter
And
He having entered
again
into
Capernaum
after [some]
days
it was heard
that
in
[the] house
He is
And
were gathered together
many
so that
no more
to have space
not even
-
at
the
door
and
He was speaking
to them
the
word
And
they come
bringing
to
Him
a paralytic
being carried
by
four
And
not
being able
to come near
to Him
on account of
the
crowd
they removed
the
roof
where
He was
and
having broken up [it]
they let down
the
pallet
on which
the
paralytic
was lying
And
having seen
-
Jesus
the
faith
of them
He says
to the
paralytic
Son
are forgiven
of you
the
sins
Were
now
some
of the
scribes
there
sitting
and
reasoning
in
the
hearts
of them
Why
this [man]
thus
does speak
He blasphemes
Who
is able
to forgive
sins
if
not
alone
-
God
And
immediately
having known
-
Jesus
in the
spirit
of Him
that
thus
they are reasoning
within
themselves
He says
to them
Why
these things
reason you
in
the
hearts
of you
Which
is
easier
to say
to the
paralytic
Are forgiven
of you
the
sins
or
to say
Arise
and
take up
the
mat
of you
and
walk
That
however
you might know
that
authority
has
the
Son
-
of Man
to forgive
sins
on
the
earth
He says
to the
paralytic
To you
I say
arise
take up
the
mat
of you
and
go
to
the
home
of you
And
he arose
and
immediately
having taken up
the
mat
he went forth
before
all
so as for
to be amazed
all
and
to glorify
-
God
saying
-
Thus
never
did we see
And
He went forth
again
beside
the
sea
and
all
the
crowd
was coming
to
Him
and
He taught
them
And
passing on
He saw
Levi
the [son]
-
of Alphaeus
sitting
at
the
tax booth
and
He says
to him
Follow
Me
And
having arisen
he followed
Him
And
it came to pass
reclining
of Him
in
the
house
of him
that
many
tax collectors
and
sinners
were reclining with
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
there were
for
many
and
they were following
Him
And
the
scribes
of the
Pharisees
having seen
Him
eating
with
the
sinners
and
tax collectors
were saying
to the
disciples
of Him
Why
with
the
tax collectors
and
sinners
does He eat
And
having heard
-
Jesus
says
to them
No
need
have
those
being strong
of a physician
but
those
sick
being
Not
I came
to call
[the] righteous
but
sinners
And
were
the
disciples
of John
and
the
Pharisees
fasting
And
they come
and
say
to Him
Because of
why
the
disciples
of John
and
the
disciples
of the
Pharisees
fast
-
but
Your
disciples
not
fast
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
Not
are able
the
sons
of the
bridechamber
in
which
the
bridegroom
with
them
is
to fast
As long as
time
they have
the
bridegroom
with
them
not
they are able
to fast
Will come
however
[the] days
when
will have been taken away
from
them
the
bridegroom
and
then
they will fast
in
those
the
days
No one
a patch
of cloth
unshrunk
sews
on
clothing
old
if
now
not
tears away
the
patch
from
it
-
new
from the
old
And
worse
a tear
takes place
And
no one
puts
wine
new
into
wineskins
old
if
now
not
will burst
the
wine
the
wineskins
and
the
wine
will be destroyed
and
the
wineskins
Instead
wine
new
into
wineskins
new
And
it came to pass
He
on
the
Sabbaths
is passing
through
the
grainfields
and
the
disciples
of Him
began
[their] way
to make
plucking
the
heads of grain
And
the
Pharisees
were saying
to Him
Behold
why
do they
on the
Sabbaths
that which
not
is lawful
And
He said
to them
Never
did you read
what
did
David
when
need
he had
and
hungered
he
and
those
with
him
How
he entered
into
the
house
-
of God
in [the days of]
Abiathar
the high priest
and
the
loaves
of the
presentation
ate
which
not
it is lawful
to eat
if
not
for the
priests
And
he gave
even
to those
with
him
being
And
He said
to them
The
Sabbath
on account of
the
man
was made
and
not
the
man
on account of
the
Sabbath
So then
Lord
is
the
Son
-
of Man
also even
of the
Sabbath
And
He entered
again
into
synagogue
and
there was
there
a man
withered
having
the
hand
and
they were watching
Him
whether
on the
Sabbaths
He will heal
him
in order that
they might accuse
Him
And
He says
to the
man
-
the
hand
having
withered
Arise
into
the
midst
And
He says
to them
Is it lawful
on the
Sabbaths
to do good

or
to do evil
Life
to save
or
to kill
-
But
they were silent
And
having looked around on
them
with
anger
being grieved
at
the
hardness
of the
heart
of them
He says
to the
man
Stretch out
the
hand
And
he stretched [it] out
and
was restored
the
hand
of him
And
having gone out
the
Pharisees
immediately
with
the
Herodians
counsel
began to take
against
Him
how
Him
they might destroy
And
-
Jesus
with
the
disciples
of Him
withdrew
to
the
sea
and
great
a multitude
from
-
Galilee
followed
and
from
-
Judea
and
from
Jerusalem
and
from
-
Idumea
and
beyond
the
Jordan
and
around
Tyre
and
Sidon
A multitude
great
having heard
how much
He was doing
came
to
Him
And
He spoke
to the
disciples
of Him
that
a boat
might wait upon
Him
on account of
the
crowd
that
not
they might press upon
Him
Many
for
He healed
so as for
to press upon
Him
that
Him
they might touch
as many as
had
diseases
And
the
spirits
-
unclean
whenever
Him
they beheld
were falling down before
Him
and
crying out
saying
-
You
are
the
Son
-
of God
And
much
He would rebuke
them
so that
not
Him
known
they should make
And
He goes up
on
the
mountain
and
calls near
those whom
he wanted
Himself
and
they went
to
Him
And
He appointed
twelve
that
they might be
with
Him
and
that
He might send
them
to preach
and
to have
authority
to cast out
-
demons
And
He appointed
the
Twelve
And
He added
[the] name
to
Simon
Peter
and
James
the [son]
of
Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
-
of James
and
He added
to them [the]
name
Boanerges
which
is
Sons
of thunder
and
Andrew
and
Philip
and
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
and
Thomas
and
James
the [son]
-
of Alphaeus
and
Thaddaeus
and
Simon
the
Zealot
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
also
betrayed
Him
And
He comes
to
a house
and
comes together
again
a
crowd
so that
not
are they able
them
even
bread
to eat
And
having heard [of it]
those
belonging to
Him
went out
to seize
Him
they were saying
for
-
He is out of His mind
And
the
scribes
those
from
Jerusalem
having come down
were saying
-
Beelzebul
He has
and
-
By
the
prince
of the
demons
He casts out
the
demons
And
having called to [Him]
them
in
parables
He began speaking
to them
How
is able
Satan
Satan
to cast out
And
if
a kingdom
against
itself
is divided
not
is able
to stand
the
kingdom
that
And
if
a house
against
itself
is divided
not
will be able
the
house
that
to stand
And
if
-
Satan
has risen up
against
himself
and
has been divided
not
he is able
to stand
but
an end
is coming to
But
not
is able
no one
into
the
house
of the
strong man
having entered
the
goods
of him
to plunder
if
not
first
the
strong man
he binds
And
then
the
house
of him
he will plunder
Truly
I say
to you
that
all
will be forgiven
the
sons
the
of men
the
sins
and
the
blasphemies
as many as
if
they shall have blasphemed
Whoever
however
-
shall blaspheme
against
the
Spirit
-
Holy
not
has
forgiveness
to
the
age
but
guilty
is
[of] eternal
sin
For
they were saying
A spirit
unclean
he has
And
arrive
the
mother
of Him
and
the
brothers
of Him
and
outside
standing
sent
to
Him
calling
Him
And
was sitting
around
Him
a crowd
And
they said
to Him
Behold
the
mother
of You
and
the
brothers
of You
and
the
sister
of you
outside
are seeking
You
And
He answering
them
says
Who
are
the
mother
of Me
and
the
brothers
And
having looked around on
those who
around
Him
in a circle
were sitting
He says
Behold
the
mother
of Me
and
the
brothers
of Me
Whoever
-
shall do
the
will
-
of God
he
brother
of Me
and
sister
and
mother
is
And
again
He began
to teach
beside
the
sea
And
was gathered together
to
Him
a crowd
great
so that
He
into
a boat
having entered
sat
in
the
sea
and
all
the
crowd
close to
the
sea
on
the
land
was
And
He began teaching
them
in
parables
many things
and
He was saying
to them
in
the
teaching
of Him
Listen
Behold
went out
the [one]
sowing
to sow
And
it came to pass
as
-
he sowed
some
-
fell
along
the
road
and
came
the
birds
and
devoured
it
And
other
fell
upon
the
rocky place
where
not
it had
soil
much
and
immediately
it sprang up
because of
the
not
having
depth
of soil
And
after
rose
the
sun
it was scorched
and
because of
-
not
having
root
it withered away
And
other
fell
among
the
thorns
and
grew up
the
thorns
and
choked
it
and
fruit
no
it yielded
And
other
fell
into
the
soil
-
good
and
began yielding
fruit
growing up
and
increasing
and
bearing
one
thirtyfold
and
one
sixty
and
one
a hundred
And
He was saying
He who
has
ears
to hear
let him hear
And
when
He was
with
alone
began asking
Him
those
around
Him
with
the
Twelve
about the
parable
And
He was saying
to them
To you
the
mystery
has been given
of the
kingdom
-
of God
To those
however
who are
outside
in
parables
-
everything
is done
so that
Seeing
they might see
and
not
perceive
and
hearing
they might hear
and
not
understand
lest
ever
they should turn
and
should be forgiven
them
And
He says
to them
Not
understand you
the
parable
this
And
how
all
the
parables
will you understand
The [one]
sowing
the
word
sows
These
now
are
they
along
the
road
where
is sown
the
word
and
when
they hear
immediately
comes
-
Satan
and
takes away
the
word
-
having been sown
in
them
And
these
are
likewise
those
upon
the
rocky places
sown
who
when
they hear
the
word
immediately
with
joy
receive
it
and
not
they have
root
in
themselves
but
temporary
are
then
having arisen
tribulation
or
persecution
on account of
the
word
immediately
they fall away
And
these
are
those
among
the
thorns
sown
These
are
those
the
word
having heard
and
the
cares
-
of this age
and
the
deceit
of the
riches
and
-
of
the
other things
desires
entering in
choke
the
word
and
unfruitful
it becomes
And
these
are
those
upon
the
soil
-
good
having been sown
such as
hear
the
word
and
receive [it]
and
bring forth fruit
one
thirtyfold
and
one
sixty
and
one
a hundred
And
He was saying
to them
-
Not
is brought in
the
lamp
so that
under
the
basket
it might be put
or
under
the
bed
[Is it] not
that
upon
the
lampstand
it might be put
Nothing
for
there is
which [is]
hidden
if
not
that
it should be made manifest
nor
has taken place
a secret thing
but
that
it should come
to
light
If
anyone
has
ears
to hear
let him hear
And
He was saying
to them
Take heed
what
you hear
With
what
measure
you measure
it will be measured
to you
and
more will be added
to you
Whoever
for
may have
it will be given
to him
and
he who
not
has
even
that which
he has
will be taken away
from
him
And
He was saying
Thus
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
as
a man
should cast
the
seed
upon
the
earth
and
should sleep
and
rise
night
and
day
and
the
seed
should sprout
and
grow
how
not
knows
he
Of itself
the
earth
brings forth fruit
first
a plant
then
an ear
then
full
grain
in
the
ear
When
then
offers itself
the
fruit
immediately
he sends
the
sickle
for
has come
the
harvest
And
He was saying
To what
shall we liken
the
kingdom
-
of God
Or
in
what
it
parable
shall we present
As
to a grain
of mustard
which
when
it has been sown
upon
the
earth
smallest
is
of all
the
seeds
which [are]
upon
the
earth
and
when
it has been sown
it grows up
and
becomes
greater
than all
the
garden plants
and
it produces
branches
great
so that
are able
under
the
shadow
of it
the
birds
of the
air
to perch
And
with such
parables
many
He kept speaking
to them
the
word
as
they were able
to hear
Without
then
parables
not
would He speak
to them
in
private
however
to His
own
disciples
He would explain
all things
And
He says
to them
on
that
-
day
evening
having come
Let us pass over
to
the
other side
And
having dismissed
the
crowd
they take with [them]
Him
since
He was
in
the
boat
also
other
boats
were
with
Him
And
comes
a storm
violent
of wind
And
the
waves
were breaking
over
the
boat
so that
already
is being filled up
the
boat
And
He
was
in
the
stern
on
the
cushion
sleeping
And
they awaken
Him
and
say
to Him
Teacher
not
is it concern
to You
that
we perish
And
having been awoken
He rebuked
the
wind
and
said
to the
sea
Silence
be still
And
abated
the
wind
and
there was
a calm
great
And
He said
to them
Why
fearful
are you
Still not


have you
faith
And
they feared
[with] fear
great
and
were saying
to
each other
Who
then
this
is
that
even
the
wind
and
the
sea
obey
Him
And
they came
to
the
other side
of the
sea
to
the
region
of the
Gerasenes
And
having gone forth
of Him
out of
the
boat
immediately
met
Him
out of
the
tombs
a man
with
a spirit
unclean
who
the
dwelling
had
in
the
tombs
And
not even
with chains
no longer
anyone
was able
him
to bind
because
that
he
often
with shackles
and
chains
had been bound
and
had been torn in two
by
him
the
chains
and
the
shackles
had been shattered
and
no one
was able
him
to subdue
And
constantly
all
night
and
day
in
the
tombs
and
in
the
mountains
he was
crying out
and
cutting
himself
with stones
And
having seen
-
Jesus
from
afar
he ran
and
fell on his knees
before Him
And
having cried
in a voice
loud
he said
What
to me
and
to You
Jesus
Son
-
of God
the
Most High
I adjure
You
-
by God
not
me
torment
He was saying
for
to him
You come forth
the
spirit
-
unclean
out of
the
man
And
He was asking
him
What [is]
[the] name
of you
And
saying
he answered
Legion
[is] name
to Me
because
many
we are
And
he begged
Him
numerous times
that
not
them
He would send
out of
the
country
There was
now
there
near
the
mountain
a herd
of pigs
great
feeding
And
they begged
Him
saying
Send
us
into
the
pigs
so that
into
them
we may enter
And
He allowed
them
And
having gone out
the
spirits
-
unclean
entered
into
the
pigs
and
rushed
the
herd
down
the
steep bank
into
the
sea
about
two thousand
and
they were drowned
in
the
sea
And
those
feeding
them
fled
and
proclaimed [it]
to
the
city
and
to
the
country
And
they went out
to see
what
it is
that
has been done
And
they come
to
-
Jesus
and
see
the [man]
possessed by demons
sitting
clothed
and
sound minded
the [one]
having had
the
legion
and
they were afraid
And
related
to them
those
having seen [it]
how
it happened
to the [one]
being possessed by demons
and
concerning
the
pigs
And
they began
to implore
Him
to depart
from
the
region
of them
And
having entered
He
into
the
boat
was begging
Him
the [one]
having been possessed by demons
that
with
Him
he might be
And
not
He did permit
him
but
He says
to him
Go
to
the
home
of you
to
-
your own
and
report
to them
how much
the
Lord
for you
did
and
had mercy on
you
And
he departed
and
began
to proclaim
in
the
Decapolis
how much
had done
for him
-
Jesus
and
all
were marveling
And
having passed over
-
Jesus
in
the
boat
again
to
the
other side
was gathered
a crowd
great
to
Him
and
He was
beside
the
sea
And
comes
one
of the
synagogue rulers
named
Jairus
and
having seen
Him
falls
at
the
feet
of Him
and
he begs
Him
much
saying
-
The
little daughter
of me
at the end
is holding
that
having come
You would lay
the
hands
on her
so that
she might be cured
and
she shall live
And
He departed
with
him
And
was following
Him
a crowd
great
and
pressing in on
Him
And
a woman
being
with
a flux
of blood
twelve
years
and
much
having suffered
under
many
physicians
and
having spent
the
of
her
all
and
in no way
having benefited
but
rather
to
the
worse
having come
having heard
-
concerning
-
Jesus
having come up
in
the
crowd
behind
she touched
the
clothing
of Him
She was saying
for
-
If
I shall touch
even
the
garments
of Him
I will be healed
And
immediately
was dried up
the
flow
of the
blood
of her
and
she knew
in the
body
that
she was healed
from
the
affliction
And
immediately
-
Jesus
having known
in
Himself
the
out of
Him
power
having gone forth
having turned
in
the
crowd
said
Who
of Me
touched
the
garments
And
were saying
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
You see
the
crowd
pressing in on
You
and
say You
Who
Me
touched
And
He was looking around
to see
the [one]
this
having done
-
And
the woman
having been frightened
and
trembling
knowing
what
had been done
to her
came
and
fell down before
Him
and
told
Him
all
the
truth
-
And
He said
to her
Daughter
the
faith
of you
has healed
you
go
in
peace
and
be
sound
from
the
affliction
of you
[While] yet
He
is speaking
they come
from
the
ruler of synagogueâs [house]
saying
-
The
daughter
of You
is dead
why
still
trouble you
the
Teacher
-
And
Jesus
having heard
the
word
spoken
says
to the
ruler of the synagogue
Not
fear
only
believe
And
not
He allowed
no one
with
Him
to follow
if
not
-
Peter
and
James
and
John
the
brother
of James
And
they come
to
the
house
of the
ruler of the synagogue
and
He beholds
a commotion
and
weeping
and
wailing
much
And
having entered
He says
to them
Why
make you commotion
and
weep
The
child
not
is dead
but
sleeps
And
they were laughing at
Him
He
then
having put out
all
takes with [Him]
the
father
of the
child
and
the
mother
and
those
with
Him
and
enters in
where
was
the
child
And
having taken
the
hand
of the
child
He says
to her
Talitha
koum
Which
is
translated
-
Little girl
to you
I say
arise
And
immediately
arose
the
girl
and
began walking
she was
for
of years
twelve
And
they were overcome
immediately
with amazement
great
And
He instructed
them
strictly
that
no one
should know
this
and
He commanded
to be given
to her
to eat
And
He went out
from there
and
came
into
the
hometown
of Him
and
follow
Him
the
disciples
of Him
And
having come
[the] Sabbath
He began
to teach
in
the
synagogue
and
-
many
hearing
were astonished
saying
From where
to this [man]
these things
and
what [is]
the
wisdom
-
having been given
to Him
even
the
miracles
such
by
the
hands
of Him
are done
Not
this
is
the
carpenter
the
son
-
of Mary
and
brother
of James
and
Joseph
and
Judas
and
Simon
And
not
are
the
sisters
of Him
here
with
us
And
they took offense
at
Him
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
-
Not
is
a prophet
without honor
if
not
in
the
hometown
of him
and
among
-
relatives
of him
and
in
the
household
of him
And
not
He was able
there
to do
not any
work of power
if
not
on a few
sick
having laid
the
hands
He healed
And
He was amazed
because of
the
unbelief
of them
And
He was going
the
villages
around
teaching
And
He calls near
the
Twelve
and
He began
them
to send forth
two
[by] two
and
He gave
to them
authority
over the
spirits
-
unclean
And
He instructed
them
that
nothing
they should take
for [the]
journey
if
not
a staff
only
no
bread
nor
bag
nor
in
the
belt
money
but
wearing
sandals
and
not
put on
two
tunics
And
He would say
to them
Wherever
if
you enter
into
a house
there
remain
until
-
you go out
from there
And
whatever
-
place
not
will receive
you
nor
hear
you
departing
from there
shake off
the
dust
which [is]
under
the
feet
of you
for
a testimony
against them
And
having gone out
they preached
that
they should repent
And
demons
many
they were casting out
and
were anointing
with oil
many
sick
and
healing [them]
And
heard
-
King
Herod
well known
for
became
the
name
of Him
And
they were saying
-
John
the [one]
baptizing
is risen
out from
[the] dead
and
because of
this
operate
the
miraculous powers
in
him
Others
however
were saying
-
Elijah
He is
Others
now
were saying
-
A prophet
like
one
of the
prophets
Having heard
now
-
Herod
was saying
Whom
I
beheaded
John
he
is risen
Himself
for
-
Herod
having sent
seized
-
John
and
bound
him
in
prison
on account of
Herodias
the
wife
of Philip
the
brother
of him
because
her
he had married
Had been saying
for
-
John
-
to Herod
-
Not
it is lawful
for you
to have
the
wife
of the
brother
of you
-
And
Herodias
held it
against him
and
wished
him
to kill
and
not
was able
-
for
Herod
was afraid of
-
John
knowing
him
[to be] a man
righteous
and
holy
and
he kept safe
him
And
having heard
him
greatly
he was perplexed
and
gladly
him
heard
And
having come
[a] day
opportune
when
Herod
on the
birthday
of him
a banquet
made
to the
great men
of him
and
to the
chief captains
and
to the
leading [men]
-
of Galilee
and
having come in
the
daughter
of herself
-
Herodias
and
having danced
pleased
-
Herod
and
those
reclining with [him]
-
And
the king
said
to the
girl
Ask
me
whatever
if
you wish
and
I will give
to you
And
he swore
to her
that
if
me
you might ask
I will give
you
up to
half
of the
kingdom
of me
And
having gone out
she said
to the
mother
of her
What
shall I ask
-
And
she said
The
head
of John
the [one]
baptizing
And
having entered
immediately
with
haste
to
the
king
she asked
saying
I desire
that
at once
you give
to me
upon
a platter
the
head
of John
the
Baptist
And
encompassingly sorrowful
having been made
the
king
on account of
the
oaths
and
those
reclining with [him]
not
was he willing
to refuse
her
And
immediately
having sent
the
king
an executioner
he commanded
to be brought
the
head
of him
And
having gone
he beheaded
him
in
the

and
brought
the
head
of him
upon
a platter
and
gave
it
to the
girl
and
the
girl
gave
it
to the
mother
of her
And
having heard [it]
the
disciples
of him
came
and
took up
the
body
of him
and
laid
it
in
[a] tomb
And
are gathered together
the
apostles
to
-
Jesus
and
they related
to him
all things
what
they had done
and
what
they had taught
And
He said
to them
Come
you
yourselves
apart
own
to
[a] solitary
place
and
rest
a little
Were
for
those
coming
and
those
going
many
and
not even
to eat
had they opportunity
And
they went away
by
the
boat
into
[a] solitary
place
by
themselves
And
they saw
them
going
and
recognized
many
and
on foot
from
all
the
cities
ran together
there
and
went before
them
And
having gone out
He saw
a great
crowd
and
was moved with compassion
toward
them
because
they were
like
sheep
not
having
a shepherd
And
He began
to teach
them
many things
And
already
the hour
late
being
having come
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
were saying
-
Desolate
is
the
place
and
already [it is]
an hour
late
Dismiss
them
that
having gone
to
the
surrounding
region
and
villages
they might buy
for themselves
something
to eat
-
But
answering
He said
to them
Give
to them
you
[something] to eat
And
they say
to Him
Having gone
shall we buy
denarii
two hundred
of bread
and
give
them
to eat
-
And
He says
to them
How many
have you
loaves
Go
see
And
having known
they say
Five
and
two
fish
And
He commanded
them
to make recline
all
groups
[by] groups
on
the
green
grass
And
they sat down
groups
[by] groups
by
hundreds
and
by
fifties
And
having taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish
having looked up
to
the
heaven
He blessed
and
broke
the
loaves
and
He kept giving [them]
to the
disciples
that
they might set before
them
And
the
two
fish
He divided
among all
And
ate
all
and
were satisfied
And
they took up
of fragments
twelve
hand-baskets
full
and
of
the
fish
And
were
those
having eaten of
the
loaves
five thousand
men
And
immediately
He compelled
the
disciples
of Him
to enter
into
the
boat
and
to go before
to
the
other side
to
Bethsaida
until
He
should dismiss
the
crowd
And
having taken leave of
them
He departed
into
the
mountain
to pray
And
evening
having come
was
the
boat
in
the midst
of the
sea
and
He
alone
upon
the
land
And
He having seen
them
straining
in
the
rowing
was
for
the
wind
contrary
to them
About
[the] fourth
watch
of the
night
He comes
to
them
walking
on
the
sea
and
He was wishing
to pass by
them
-
And
having seen
Him
on
the
sea
walking
they thought
that
a ghost
[it] is
and
cried out
All
for
Him
saw
and
were troubled
-
And
immediately
He spoke
with
them
and
says
to them
Take courage
I
am [He]
not
fear
And
He went up
to
them
into
the
boat
and
ceased
the
wind
And
exceedingly
in
abundance
in
themselves
they were amazed
not
for
they understood
by
the
loaves
but
had been
of them
the
heart
hardened
And
having passed over
to
the
land
they came
to
Gennesaret
and
drew to shore
And
on having come
of them
out of
the
boat
immediately
having recognized
Him
they ran around
all
the
country
that
and
they began
on
the
mats
those
sick
being
to carry about
to wherever
they were hearing
that
He is
And
wherever
-
He entered
into
villages
or
into
cities
or
into
fields
in
the
marketplaces
they were laying
the
ailing
and
were begging
Him
that
only
the
fringe
the
clothing
of Him
they might touch
and
as many as
-
touched
Him
were being healed
And
are gathered together
to
Him
the
Pharisees
and
some
of the
scribes
having come
from
Jerusalem
And
they had seen
some
of the
disciples
of Him
that
with defiled
hands
that
is
unwashed
are eating
the
bread
-
For
the Pharisees
and
all
the
Jews
if
not
carefully
they wash
the
hands
not
eat
holding
the
tradition
of the
elders
and
[on coming] from
the market
if
not
they wash
not
they eat
and
other things
many
there are
which
they received
[for them] to hold to
washings
of cups
and
vessels
and
utensils
And
questioned
Him
the
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
Because of
why
not
walk
the
disciples
of You
according to
the
tradition
of the
elders
but
with unwashed
hands
eat
the
bread
-
And
He said
to them
Rightly
prophesied
Isaiah
concerning
you
-
hypocrites
as
it has been written
-
This
-
people
with the
lips
Me
honors
-
but
the heart
of them
far away
is kept
from
Me
In vain
now
they worship
Me
teaching
[as] doctrines
[the] precepts
of men
Having neglected
the
commandment
-
of God
you hold
to the
tradition
-
of men
And
He was saying
to them
Neatly
do you set aside
the
commandment
-
of God
that
the
tradition
of you
you might keep
Moses
for
said
Honor
the
Father
of you
and
the
mother
of you
and
The [one]
speaking evil of
father
or
mother
in death
must end
You
however
say [that]
if
says
a man
to the
father
or
the
mother
[It is] Corban
that
is
a gift
whatever
if
from
me
you might be profited
no longer
do you allow
him
anything
to do
for the
father
or
the
mother
making void
the
word
-
of God
for the
tradition
of you
which
you have handed down
And
like [things]
such
many
you do
And
having called to [Him]
again
the
crowd
He was saying
to them
Listen to
Me
all
and
understand
Nothing
there is
from outside
the
man
entering
into
him
which
is able
to defile
him
but
the things
out of
the
man
proceeding
are
the things
defiling
the
man
And
when
He went
into
[the] house
from
the
crowd
were asking
Him
the
disciples
of Him
the
parable
And
He says
to them
Thus
also
you
without understanding
are
Not
understand you
that
everything
-
from outside
entering
into
the
man
not
is able
him
to defile
because
not
it enters
of him
into
the
heart
but
into
the
belly
and
into
the
sewer
goes out
purifying
all
the
food
He was saying
now
-
That
out of
the
man
going forth
that
defiles
the
man
Within
for
from
the
heart
-
of men
-
thoughts
-
evil
go forth
sexual immorality
thefts
murders
adulteries
covetous desires
wickednesses
deceit
sensuality
an eye
evil
slander
pride
foolishness
All
these
-
evils
from within
go forth
and
they defile
the
man
From there
also
having risen up
He went away
into
the
region
of Tyre
And
having entered
into
a house
no one
He was wishing
to know [it]
and
not
He was able
to be hidden
But
immediately
having heard
a woman
about
Him
of whom
had
the
little daughter
of her
spirit
unclean
having come
fell
at
the
feet
of Him
-
Now
the woman
was
Gentile
Syrophoenician
by
race
and
kept asking
Him
that
the
demon
He should cast forth
out of
the
daughter
of her
And
He was saying
to her
Permit
first
to be satisfied
the
children
not
for
it is
good
to take
the
bread
of the
children
and
to the
dogs
to cast [it]
-
But
she answered
and
says
to Him
Yes
Lord
even
the
dogs
under
the
table
eat
of
the
crumbs
of the
children
And
He said
to her
Because of
this
-
word
go
has gone forth
out of
the
daughter
of you
the
demon
And
having gone away
to
the
home
of her
she found
the
child
lying
on
the
bed
and
the
demon
having gone out
And
again
having departed
from
the
region
of Tyre
He came
through
Sidon
to
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
through
[the] midst
of the
region
of [the] Decapolis
And
they bring
to Him
a deaf man
and
who spoke with difficulty
and
they implore
Him
that
He might lay
on him
the
hand
And
having taken away
him
from
the
crowd
aside
privately
He put
the
fingers
of Him
to
the
ears
of him
and
having spit
He touched
the
tongue
of him
and
having looked up
to
-
heaven
He sighed deeply
and
He says
to him
Ephphatha
that
is
Be opened
And
were opened
his
-
ears
and
immediately
was loosed
the
band
of the
tongue
of him
and
he began speaking
plainly
And
He instructed
them
that
no one
they should tell
As much as
however
He
kept instructing
them
more
abundantly
they were proclaiming [it]
And
above measure
they were astonished
saying
Well
all things
He has done
both
the
deaf
He makes
to hear
and
mute
to speak
In
those
-
days
again
great
[the] crowd
being
and
not
having
what
they might eat
having called to [Him]
the
disciples
He says
to them
I am moved with compassion
upon
the
crowd
because
already
days
three
they continue
with Me
and
nothing
have
that
they might eat
And
if
I shall send away
them
hungry
to
[the] homes
of them
they will faint
on
the
way
For
some
of them
from
afar
are come
And
answered
Him
the
disciples
of Him
-
From where
these
will be able
anyone
here
to satisfy
with bread
in
this desolate place
And
He was asking
them
How many
have you
loaves
-
And
they said
Seven
And
He directs
the
crowd
to recline
on
the
ground
And
having taken
the
seven
loaves
having given thanks
He broke [them]
and
kept giving [them]
to
disciples
of Him
that
they might set before [them]
And
they set [it] before
the
crowd
And
they had
small fish
a few
And
having blessed
them
He ordered
also
these
to be set before [them]
And
they ate
and
were satisfied
And
they took up
over and above
of fragments
seven
baskets
There were
now
about
four thousand
And
He sent away
them
And
immediately
having entered
into
the
boat
with
the
disciples
of Him
He came
into
the
district
of Dalmanutha
And
went out
the
Pharisees
and
began
to dispute with
Him
seeking
from
Him
a sign
from
-
heaven
testing
Him
And
having sighed deeply
in the
spirit
of Him
He says
Why
the
generation
this
seeks
a sign
Truly
I say
to you
if
there will be given
to the
generation
this
a sign
And
having left
them
again
having embarked
He went away
to
the
other side
And
they forgot
to take
loaves
and
if
not
one
loaf
not
they had
with
them
in
the
boat
And
He was instructing
them
saying
Watch out
take heed
of
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
of the
leaven
of Herod
And
they were reasoning
with
one another
because
loaves
not
they have
And
having known [it]
He says
to them
Why
reason you
because
loaves
not
you have
Not yet
do you perceive
nor
understand
Hardened
do you have
the
heart
of you
Eyes
having
not
do you see
And
ears
having
not
do you hear
And
not
do you remember
When
the
five
loaves
I broke
for
the
five thousand
how many
hand-baskets
of fragments
full
took you up
They say
to Him
Twelve
When
the
seven
to
the
four thousand
of how many
baskets
[the] fillings
of fragments
took you up
And
said
Seven
And
He was saying
to them
Not yet
do you understand
And
they come
to
Bethsaida
And
they bring
to Him
a blind [man]
and
implore
Him
that
him
He might touch
And
having taken hold of
the
hand
of the
blind [man]
He led forth
him
out
of the
village
and
having spit
upon
the
eyes
of him
having laid
the
hands
upon him
He was asking
him
if
anything
you see
And
having looked up
he was saying
I see
the
men
for
as
trees
I see [them]
walking
Then
again
He laid
the
hands
upon
the
eyes
of him
and
he opened his eyes
and
he was restored
and
he began to see
clearly
everything
And
He sent
him
to
[the] home
of him
saying
Not
into
the
village
may you enter
And
went forth
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
into
the
villages
of Caesarea
-
Philippi
And
on
the
way
He was questioning
the
disciples
of Him
saying
to them
Whom
Me
do pronounce
-
men
to be
-
And
they answered
Him
saying
-
John
the
Baptist
and
others
Elijah
others
now
-
one
of the
prophets
And
He
was questioning
them
You
however
whom
Me
do pronounce
to be
Answering
-
Peter
says
to Him
You
are
the
Christ
And
He warned
them
that
no one
they should tell
concerning
Him
And
He began
to teach
them
that
it is necessary for
the
Son
-
of Man
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
the
elders
and
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
to be killed
and
after
three
days
to rise [again]
And
openly
the
word
He was speaking
And
having taken Him
-
Peter
to him
he began
to rebuke
Him
-
And
having turned
and
having looked upon
the
disciples
of Him
He rebuked
Peter
and
said
Get
behind
Me
Satan
for
not
you have in mind
the
things
of God
but
the
things
of men
And
having called to [Him]
the
crowd
with
the
disciples
of Him
He said
to them
If
anyone
desires
after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
let him take up
the
cross
of him
and
let him follow
Me
Whoever
for
if
might desire
-
life
his
to save
will lose
it
whoever
now
-
will lose
the
life
of him
on account of
Me
and
of the
gospel
he will save
it
What
for
does it profit
a man
to gain
the
world
whole
and
to lose
the
soul
of him
What
for
shall give
a man
[as] an exchange
for the
soul
of him
Whoever
for
if
may be ashamed of
Me
and
-
My
words
in
the
generation
this
-
adulterous
and
sinful
also
the
Son
-
of Man
will be ashamed of
him
when
He shall come
in
the
glory
of the
Father
of Him
with
the
angels
-
holy
And
He was saying
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
there are
some
here
of those
standing
who
no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
they see
the
kingdom
-
of God
having come
with
power
And
after
days
six
takes along
-
Jesus
-
Peter
and
-
James
and
John
and
brings up
them
into
a mountain
high
apart
themselves
alone
And
He was transfigured
before
them
and
the
garments
of Him
became
shining
white
exceedingly
such as
a launderer
on
the
earth
not
is able
thus
to whiten
And
appeared
to them
Elijah
with
Moses
and
they were
talking with
-
Jesus
And
answering
-
Peter
says
-
to Jesus
Rabbi
good
it is
for us
here
to be
And
let us make
three
tabernacles
for You
one
and
for Moses
one
and
for Elijah
one
Not
for
he knew
what
he should say
terrified
for
they were
And
there came
a cloud
overshadowing
them
and
there came
a voice
out of
the
cloud
This
is
the
Son
of Me
the
beloved
listen you
to Him
And
suddenly
having looked around
no longer
no one
they saw
except
-
Jesus
alone
with
them
And
descending
of them
from
the
mountain
He instructed
them
that
to no one
what
they had seen
they should tell
if
not
until
the
Son
-
of Man
out from
[the] dead
had risen
And
that
saying
they kept
among
themselves
questioning
what
it is
-
out from
the dead
to rise
And
they were asking
Him
saying
-
Say
the
scribes
that
Elijah
it behooves
to come
first
-
And
He was saying
to them
Elijah
indeed
having come
first
restores
all things
and
how
has it been written
of
the
Son
-
of Man
that
many things
He should suffer
and
be set at naught
But
I say
to you
that
also
Elijah
has come
and
they did
to him
whatever
they desired
as
it has been written
of
him
And
having come
to
the
disciples
they saw
a crowd
great
around
them
and
scribes
arguing
with
them
And
immediately
all
the
crowd
having seen
Him
were greatly amazed
and
running to [Him]
were greeting
Him
And
He asked
them
What
are you disputing
with
them
And
answered
Him
one
out of
the
crowd
Teacher
I brought
the
son
of me
to
You
having
a spirit
mute
and
whenever
if
him
it seizes
it throws down
him
and
he foams
and
gnashes
-
his teeth
and
is withering away
And
I spoke
to the
disciples
of You
that
it
they might cast out
and
not
they had power
-
And
answering
him
He says
O
generation
unbelieving
Until
when
with
you
will I be
Until
when
will I bear with
you
Bring
him
to
Me
And
they brought
him
to
Him
And
having seen
Him
the
spirit
immediately
threw into convulsions
him
and
having fallen
upon
the
ground
he began rolling around
foaming
And
He asked
the
father
of him
How long
a time
is it
that
this
has been
with him
-
And
he said
From
childhood
And
often
both
into
fire
him
it casts
and
into
waters
that
it might destroy
him
But
if
anything
You are able [to do]
help
us
having compassion
on
us
-
And
Jesus
said
to him
-
If
You are able
All things
are possible
to the [one]
believing
Immediately
having cried out
the
father
of the
child
was saying
I believe
help
of me
the
unbelief
Having seen
now
-
Jesus
that
was running together
a crowd
He rebuked
the
spirit
-
unclean
saying
to it
-
Mute
and
deaf
spirit
I
command
you
come
out of
him
and
no more
may you enter
into
him
And
having cried out
and
much
having thrown him into convulsions
it came out
and
he became
as if
dead
in order for
-
many
to say
that
he was dead
-
And
Jesus
having taken
by the
hand
him
raised up
him
and
he arose
And
having entered
He
into
a house
the
disciples
of Him
in
private
were asking
Him
Why
we
not
were able
to cast out
it
And
He said
to them
This
-
kind
by
nothing
is able
to go out
if
not
by
prayer
From there
having gone forth
they were passing
through
-
Galilee
and
not
did He want
that
anyone
should know [it]
He was teaching
for
the
disciples
of Him
and
He was saying
to them
-
The
Son
-
of Man
is delivered
into [the]
hands
of men
and
they will kill
Him
and
having been killed
on the
third
day
He will arise
-
And
they did not understand
the
saying
and
they were afraid
Him
to ask
And
they came
to
Capernaum
And
in
the
house
having been
He was asking
them
What
on
the
way
were you discussing
-
And
they were silent
with
one another
for
they had been discussing
along
the
road
which [was]
greatest
And
having sat down
He called
the
Twelve
and
He says
to them
If
anyone
desires
first
to be
he will be
of all
last
and
of all
servant
And
having taken
a child
He set
it
in
midst
of them
and
having taken in [His] arms
it
He said
to them
Whoever
-
one
-
of such
little children
shall receive
in
the
name
of Me
Me
receives
and
whoever
-
Me
shall receive
not
Me
receives
but
the [One]
having sent
Me
Answered
Him
-
John
Teacher
we saw
someone
in
the
name
of You
casting out
demons
who
not
does follow
us
and
we were forbidding
him
because
not
he was following
us
-
And
Jesus
said
Not
forbid
him
No one
for
there is
who
will do
a work of power
in
the
name
of Me
and
will be able
readily
to speak evil of
Me
Whoever
for
not
is
against
us
for
us
is
Whoever
for
-
might give to drink
you
a cup
of water
in
name
because
Christâs
you are
truly
I say
to you
that
no
not
shall he lose
the
reward
of him
And
whoever
-
might cause to stumble
one
of the
little ones
these
-
believing
better
it is
for him
rather
if
is put
a millstone
heavy
around
the
neck
of him
and
he has been cast
into
the
sea
And
if
should cause to stumble
you
the
hand
of you
cut off
it
better
it is
for you
crippled
to enter
into
-
life
than
-
two
hands
having
to go away
into
-
hell
into
the
fire
-
unquenchable
And
if
the
foot
of you
should cause to stumble
you
cut off
it
better
it is
for you
to enter
into
-
life
lame
than
the
two
feet
having
to be cast
into
-
hell
And
if
the
eye
of you
should cause to stumble
you
cast out
it
better
for you
it is
with one eye
to enter
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
than
two
eyes
having
to be cast
into
-
hell
where
the
worm
of them
not
dies
and
the
fire
not
is quenched
Everyone
for
with fire
will be salted
Good [is]
the
salt
if
however
the
salt
unsalty
becomes
with
what
it
will you season
Have
in
yourselves
salt
and
be at peace
with
one another
And
from there
having risen up
He comes
into
the
region
-
of Judea
and
beyond
the
Jordan
And
come together
again
crowds
to
Him
and
as
He had been accustomed
again
He was teaching
them
And
having come to [him]
the Pharisees
were demanding
of Him
if
it is lawful
for a husband
a wife
to divorce
testing
Him
-
And
He answering
said
to them
What
you
did command
Moses
-
And
they said
Permitted
Moses
a roll
of divorce
to write
and
to send [her] away
-
But
Jesus
said
to them
Because of
the
hardness of heart
of you
He wrote
for you
the
commandment
this
From
however
[the] beginning
of creation
Male
and
female
He made
them
On account of
this
will leave
a man
the
father
of him
and
-
mother
and
will be
the
two
for
flesh
one
Therefore
no longer
they are
two
but
one
flesh
What
therefore
-
God
has joined together
man
not
let separate
And
in
the
house
again
the
disciples
concerning
this
were asking
Him
And
He says
to them
Whoever
-
shall divorce
the
wife
of him
and
shall marry
another
commits adultery
against
her
And
if
a woman
having divorced
the
husband
of her
should marry
another
she commits adultery
And
they were bringing
to Him
little children
that
them
He might touch
-
But
the disciples
rebuked
them
Having seen
now
-
Jesus
was indignant
and
said
to them
Permit
the
little children
to come
to
Me
not
do hinder
them
To the
for
such
belongs
the
kingdom
-
of God
Truly
I say
to you
whoever
-
not
shall receive
the
kingdom
-
of God
as
a child
no
not
shall enter
into
it
And
having taken [them] in arms
them
He was blessing
having laid
the
hands
on
them
And
going forth
of Him
on
[the] journey
having run up
one
and
having knelt down to
Him
was asking
Him
Teacher
good
what
shall I do
that
life
eternal
I might inherit
-
And
Jesus
said
to him
Why
Me
call you
good
No one [is]
good
if
not
alone
-
God
The
commandments
you know
Not
shall you murder
not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
not
shall you defraud
you shall honor
the
father
of you
and
the
mother
-
And
he was saying
to Him
Teacher
these
all
I have kept
from
[the] youth
of me
-
And
Jesus
having looked upon
him
loved
him
and
said
to him
One thing
to you
is lacking
Go
as much as
you have
sell
and
give
to the
poor
and
you will have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
follow
Me
-
And
having been sad
at
the
word
he went away
grieving
he was [one]
for
having
possessions
many
And
having looked around
-
Jesus
says
the
disciples
of Him
How
difficultly
those
-
riches
having
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
will enter
-
And
the disciples
were astonished
at
the
words
of Him
-
But
Jesus
again
answering
says
to them
Children
how
difficult
it is
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
to enter
Easier
it is
[for] a camel
through
the
eye
of the
needle
to pass
than [for]
a rich man
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
to enter
-
And
exceedingly
they were astonished
saying
among
themselves
Then
who
is able
to be saved
Having looked on
them
-
Jesus
says
With
men
[it is] impossible
but
not
with
God
all things
for
[are] possible
with
-
God
Began
to say
-
Peter
to Him
Behold
we
have left
all
and
followed
You
Was saying
-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
no one
there is
who
has left
house
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
mother
or
father
or
children
or
lands
for the sake
of me
and
because
of the
gospel
if
not
shall take
a hundredfold
now
in
the
time
this
houses
and
brothers
and
sisters
and
mothers
and
children
and
lands
with
persecutions
and
in
the
age
which
is coming
life
eternal
Many
however
will be
first
last
and
the
last
first
They were
then
on
the
way
going up
to
Jerusalem
and
was
going on before
them
-
Jesus
and
they were astonished
those
then
following
were afraid
And
having taken to [Him]
again
the
Twelve
He began
them
to tell
the things
being about
to Him
to happen
-
Behold
we go up
to
Jerusalem
and
the
Son
-
of Man
will be betrayed
to the
chief priests
and
to the
scribes
and
they will condemn
Him
to death
and
will betray
Him
to the
Gentiles
And
they will mock
Him
and
will spit upon
Him
and
will flog
Him
and
will kill
and
on the
third
day
He will rise again
And
come up
to Him
James
and
John
the
sons
of Zebedee
saying to
Him
Teacher
we desire
that
whatever
if
we might ask
you
You would do
for us
-
And
He said
to them
What
do you desire
Me
to do
for you
-
And
they said
to Him
Grant
to us
that
one
of [us]
at
[Your] right hand
and
one
at
[Your] left hand
we might sit
in
the
glory
of You
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
Not
you know
what
you ask
Are you able
to drink
the
cup
which
I
drink
and
the
baptism
which
I
am baptized
to be baptized [with]
-
And
they said
to Him
We are able
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
The
cup
which
I
drink
you will drink
and
the
baptism
which
I
am baptized
you will be baptized [with]
-
but
to sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
or
at
[the] left hand
not
is
Mine
to give
but [to those]
for whom
it has been prepared
And
having heard [this]
the
ten
began
to be indignant
about
James
and
John
And
having called near
them
-
Jesus
says
to them
You know
that
those
being accounted
to rule over
the
Gentiles
exercise lordship over
them
and
those
great ones
of them
exercise authority over
them
Not
thus
however
shall it be
among
you
Instead
whoever
-
desires
great
to become
among
you
will be
your
servant
and
whoever
-
desires
among
you
to become
first
will be
of all
slave
Even
for
the
Son
-
of Man
not
came
to be served
but
to serve
and
to give
the
life
of Him
[as] a ransom
for
many
And
they come
to
Jericho
And
as was going out
He
from
Jericho
and
the
disciples
of Him
and
a crowd
large
the
son
of Timaeus
Bartimaeus
blind
beggar
was sitting
beside
the
road
And
having heard
that
Jesus
of
Nazareth
it is
he began
to cry out
and
to say
Son
of David
Jesus
have mercy on
me
And
were rebuking
him
many
that
he should be silent
-
but
much
more
he kept crying out
Son
of David
have mercy on
me
And
having stopped
-
Jesus
commanded
to be called
him
And
they call
the
blind [man]
saying
to him
Take courage
Rise up
He calls
you
-
And
having cast away
the
cloak
of him
having risen up
he came
to
-
Jesus
And
answering
him
-
Jesus
says
What
to you
do you desire
I should do
-
And
the blind [man]
said
to Him
Rabboni
that
I may receive sight
And
-
Jesus
said
to him
Go
the
faith
of you
has healed
you
And
immediately
he received sight
and
he began following
Him
on
the
way
And
when
they drew near
to
Jerusalem
to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
near
the
Mount
-
of Olives
He sends
two
of the
disciples
of Him
and
says
to them
Go
into
the
village
-
before
you
and
immediately
entering
into
it
you will find
a colt
having been tied
upon
which
no one
not yet
of men
has sat
having untied
it
also
bring [it]
And
if
anyone
to you
says
Why
are you doing
this
say
the
Lord
of it
need
has
and
soon
it
He will send
back
here
And
they departed
and
found
the colt
having been tied
at
the door
outside
by
the
street
and
they untied
it
And
some
of those
there
standing
were saying
to them
What
are you doing
untying
the
colt
-
And
they spoke
to them
as
had commanded
-
Jesus
and
they allowed
them
And
they led
the
colt
to
-
Jesus
and
they cast upon
it
the
cloaks
of them
and
He sat
on
it
And
many
the
cloaks
of them
spread
on
the
road
others
then
branches
having been cut down
from
the
fields
And
those
going before
and
those
following
were crying out
Hosanna
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
in [the]
name
of [the] Lord
Blessed
[is] the
coming
kingdom
of the
father
of us
David
Hosanna
in
the
highest
And
He entered
into
Jerusalem
into
the
temple
and
having looked around on
all things
late
already
being
the
hour
He went out
to
Bethany
with
the
Twelve
And
on the
next day
having gone out
they
from
Bethany
He was hungry
And
having seen
a fig tree
from
afar
having
leaves
He went
if
perhaps
anything
He will find
on
it
And
having come
to
it
nothing
He found
if
not
leaves
the
for
season
not
it was
of figs
And
answering
He said
to it
No more
to
the
age
of
you
no one
fruit
may eat
And
were listening
the
disciples
of Him
And
they come
to
Jerusalem
And
having entered
into
the
temple
He began
to cast out
those
selling
and
those
buying
in
the
temple
and
the
tables
of the
money changers
and
the
seats
of those
selling
the
doves
He overturned
And
not
He would permit
that
anyone
should carry
a vessel
through
the
temple
And
He began teaching
and
was saying
to them
Not
has it been written
-
The
house
of Me
a house
of prayer
will be called
for all
the
nations
You
however
have made
it
a den
of robbers
And
heard [it]
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
they were seeking
how
Him
they might destroy
they were afraid of
for
Him
all
for
the
crowd
was astonished
at
the
teaching
of Him
And
when
evening
came
they were going forth
out of
the
city
And
passing by
in the morning
they saw
the
fig tree
having been dried up
from [the]
roots
And
having remembered
-
Peter
says
to Him
Rabbi
look
the
fig tree
that
You cursed
is dried up
And
answering
-
Jesus
says
to them
Have
faith
from God
Truly
I say
to you
that
whoever
-
shall say
to the
mountain
this
Be you taken away
and
be you cast
into
the
sea
and
not
shall doubt
in
the
heart
of him
but
shall believe
that
what
he says
takes place
it will be done
for him
Because of
this
I say
to you
all things
whatever
praying
also
you ask
believe
that
you receive
and
it will be
to you
And
when
you may stand
praying
forgive
if
anything
you have
against
anyone
so that
also
the
Father
of you
who [is]
in
the
heavens
might forgive
you
the
trespasses
of you
And
they come
again
to
Jerusalem
And
in
the
temple
is walking
as He
come
to
Him
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
And
they were saying
to Him
By
what
authority
these things
are You doing
Or
who
You
gave
the
authority
this
that
these things
You should do
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
I will ask
you
one
question
and
you answer
Me
and
I will tell
you
by
what
authority
these things
I do
The
baptism
-
of John
from
heaven
was it
or
from
men
Answer
Me
And
they began reasoning
with
themselves
saying
If
we should say
From
heaven
He will say
Because of
why
then
not
did you believe
him
But
should we say
From
men
they were afraid of
the
people
all
for
were holding
-
John
truly
that
a prophet
he was
And
answering
-
to Jesus
they say
Not
do we know
And
-
Jesus
says
to them
Neither
I
tell
you
by
what
authority
these things
I do
And
He began
to them
in
parables
to speak
A vineyard
a man
planted
and
he placed around [it]
a fence
and
dug
a wine vat
and
built
a tower
and
rented out
it
to farmers
and
traveled abroad
And
he sent
to
the
farmers
at the
due time
a servant
that
from
the
farmers
he might receive
from
the
fruit
of the
vineyard
But
having taken
him
they beat [him]
and
sent [him] away
empty-handed
And
again
he sent
to
them
another
servant
and him
they struck on the head
and
treated shamefully
And
another
He sent
and him
they killed
also
many
others
some
indeed
beating
some
then
killing
Yet
one
having
son
beloved
he sent
him
last
to
them
saying
-
They will have respect for
the
son
of me
Those
however
-
farmers
to
themselves
said
-
This
is
the
heir
come
let us kill
him
and
ours
will be
the
inheritance
And
having taken
they killed
him
and
cast forth
him
outside
the
vineyard
What
will do
the
master
of the
vineyard
He will come
and
will destroy
the
farmers
and
will give
the
vineyard
to others
Not even
the
Scripture
this
have you read
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
building
this
has become
the
chief
corner
from [the]
Lord
was
this
and
it is
marvelous
in
[the] eyes
of us
And
they were seeking
Him
to lay hold of
and
they feared
the
crowd
they knew
for
that
against
them
the
parable
He had spoken
And
having left
Him
they went away
And
they send
to
Him
some
of the
Pharisees
and
of the
Herodians
that
Him
they might catch
in discourse
And
having come
they say
to Him
Teacher
we know
that
true
You are
and
not
there is care
to You
about
no one
not
for
You look
on [the]
appearance
of men
but
on the basis of
[the] truth
the
way
-
of God
teach
Is it lawful
to give
tribute
to Caesar
or
not
Should we pay
or
not
pay
-
And
knowing
of them
the
hypocrisy
He said
to them
Why
Me
do you test
Bring
Me
a denarius
that
I might see [it]
-
And
they brought [it]
And
He says
to them
Whose [is]
the
likeness
this
and
the
inscription
-
And
they said
to Him
Caesarâs
-
And
Jesus
said
to them
The things
of Caesar
give back
to Caesar
and
the things
-
of God
-
to God
And
they were amazed
at
Him
And
come
Sadducees
to
Him
who
say
a resurrection
not
there is
and
they began questioning
Him
saying
Teacher
Moses
wrote
for us
that
if
of anyone
a brother
should die
and
leave behind
a wife
and
not
leave
children
that
should take
the
brother
of him
the
wife
and
raise up
seed
for the
brother
of him
Seven
brothers
there were
and
the
first
took
a wife
and
dying
not
left
seed
And
the
second
took
her
and
died
not
having left
seed
and
the
third
likewise
And
the
seven
not
left
seed
Last
of all
also
the
woman
died
In
the
resurrection
when
they rise
of which
of them
will she be
wife
-
For
the seven
had
her
as wife
Was saying
to them
-
Jesus
Not
because of
this
do you err
not
knowing
the
Scriptures
nor
the
power
-
of God
When
for
out from
[the] dead
they rise
neither
do they marry
nor
are given in marriage
but
are
like
angels
in
the
heavens
Concerning
now
the
dead
that
they rise
not
have you read
in
the
book
of Moses
on
the
bush
how
spoke
to him
-
God
saying
I [am]
the
God
of Abraham
and
God
of Isaac
and
God
of Jacob
Not
He is
God
of [the] dead
but
of [the] living
Greatly
you err
And
having come up
one
of the
scribes
having heard
them
reasoning together
having seen
that
well
He answered
them
he questioned
Him
Which
is
commandment
[the] first
of all
Answered
-
Jesus
The
foremost
is
Hear this
O Israel
[The] Lord
-
God
of us
[the] Lord
One
is
and
you shall love
[the] Lord
-
God
of you
with
all
the
heart
of you
and
with
all
the
soul
of you
and
with
all
the
mind
of you
and
with
all
the
strength
of you
[The] second
this
You shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
Greater
than these
another
commandment
not
there is
And
said
to Him
the
scribe
Right
Teacher
according to
truth
You have spoken
that
One
He is
and
not
there is
another
besides
Him
and
-
to love
Him
with
all
the
heart
and
with
all
the
understanding
and
with
all
the
strength
and
-
to love
the
neighbor
as
oneself
more important
is
than all
the
burnt offerings
and
sacrifices
And
-
Jesus
having seen
him
that
wisely
he answered
said
to him
Not
far
are you
from
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
no one
no longer
dared
Him
to question
And
answering
-
Jesus
was saying
teaching
in
the
temple
How
say
the
scribes
that
the
Christ
[the] son
of David
is
Himself
David
said
by
the
Spirit
-
Holy
Said
[the] Lord
to the
Lord
of me
Sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
of the
enemies
of You
[as] a footstool
of the
feet
of You
Himself
David
calls
Him
Lord
then
how
of him
is He
son
And
the
great
crowd
was listening
to Him
gladly
And
in
the
teaching
of Him
He was saying
Beware
of
the
scribes
-
desiring
in
robes
to walk about
and
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
first seats
in
the
synagogues
and
first places
at
the
feasts
those
devouring
the
houses
of the
widows
and
as a pretext
at great length
praying
These
will receive
greater
judgment
And
having sat down
opposite
the
treasury
He was watching
how
the
crowd
cast
money
into
the
treasury
and
many
rich
were casting [in]
much
And
having come
one
widow
poor
cast [in]
lepta
two
which
is
a kodrantes
And
having called to [Him]
the
disciples
of Him
He says
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
the
widow
this
-
poor
more
than all
has cast [in]
of those
casting
into
the
treasury
All
for
out of
that which
was abounding
to them
cast [in]
she
however
out of
the
poverty
of her
all
as much as
she had
cast [in]
all
the
livelihood
of her
And
going forth
of Him
out of
the
temple
says
to Him
one
of the
disciples
of Him
Teacher
behold
what
stones
and
what
buildings
And
-
Jesus
said
to him
See you
these
-
great
buildings
No
not
shall be left
stone
upon
stone
which
no
not
shall be thrown down
And
sitting
of Him
upon
the
Mount
-
of Olives
opposite
the
temple
asked
Him
in
private
Peter
and
James
and
John
and
Andrew
Tell
us
when
these things
will be
And
what [will be]
the
sign
when
are going
these things
to be accomplished
all
-
And
Jesus
began
to say
to them
Take heed
lest
anyone
you
mislead
Many
will come
in
the
name
of Me
saying
-
I
am [He]
and
many
they will mislead
When
then
you shall hear of
wars
and
rumors
of wars
not
be disturbed
it must
come to pass
but
not yet [is]
the
end
Will rise up
for
nation
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
There will be
earthquakes
throughout
places
there will be
famines
[The] beginning
of birth pains [are]
these
Take heed
however
you
to yourselves
they will betray
you
to
courts
and
in
synagogues
you will be beaten
and
before
governors
and
kings
you will stand
because
of Me
for
a testimony
to them
And
to
all
the
nations
first
it behooves
to proclaim
the
gospel
And
when
they might lead away
you
delivering [you] up
not
be anxious beforehand
what
you should say
but
whatever
if
might be given
to you
in
that
-
hour
that
speak
not
for
are
you
those
speaking
but
the
Spirit
-
Holy
And
will deliver up
brother
brother
to
death
and
father
child
and
will rise up
children
against
parents
and
will put to death
them
And
you will be
hated
by
all
on account of
the
name
of Me
the [one]
however
having endured
to
[the] end
he
will be saved
When
then
you see
the
abomination
of the
desolation
standing
where
not
it should
the [one]
reading
let him understand
then
those
in
-
Judea
let them flee
to
the
mountains
the [one]
upon
the
housetop
not
let him come down
nor
go in
anything
to take
out of
the
house
of him
and
the [one]
in
the
field
not
let him return
to
the things
behind
to take
the
clothing
of him
Woe
then
to those
in
womb
having
and
to the [ones]
nursing infants
in
those
-
days
Pray
then
that it
not
might be
in winter
will be [in]
for
the
days
those
tribulation
such as
never
has been
the like
from [the]
beginning
of creation
which
created
-
God
until
-
now
and
never
not
shall be
And
if
not
had shortened
[the] Lord
the
days
no
-
there would have been saved
any
flesh
but
on account of
the
elect
whom
He chose
He has shortened
the
days
And
then
if
anyone
to you
says
Behold
here [is]
the
Christ
Behold
there
not
you shall believe [it]
There will arise
for
false Christs
and
false prophets
and
will give
signs
and
wonders
so as
-
to deceive
if
possible
the
elect
You
however
take heed
I have foretold
to you
all things
But
in
those
-
days
after
the
tribulation
those
The
sun
will be darkened
and
the
moon
not
will give
the
light
of it
and
the
stars
will be
out of
the
heaven
falling
and
the
powers
that [are]
in
the
heavens
will be shaken
And
then
will they see
the
Son
-
of Man
coming
in
[the] clouds
with
power
great
and
glory
And
then
He will send
the
angels
and
will gather together
the
elect
of Him
from
the
four
winds
from [the]
end
of earth
to [the]
end
of heaven
Of
now
the
fig tree
learn
the
parable
When
already
the
branch
of it
tender
has become
and
it puts forth
the
leaves
you know
that
near
the
summer
is
So
also
you
when
you see
these things
coming to pass
know
that
near
He is
at [the]
doors
Truly
I say
to you
that
no
not
will have passed away
the
generation
this
until
that
these things
all
shall have taken place
The
heaven
and
the
earth
will pass away
-
but
the words
of Me
in no way
will pass away
Concerning
now
the
day
that
or
the
hour
no one
knows
not even
the
angels
in
heaven
nor
the
Son
if
not
the
Father
Take heed
watch
not
you know
for
when
the
time
is
[It is] like
a man
going on a journey
having left
the
house
of him
and
having given
the
servants
of him
-
authority
to each one
the
work
of him
And
the
doorkeeper
he commanded
that
he should keep watch
Watch
therefore
not
you know
for
when
the
master
of the
house
comes
or
at evening
or
at midnight
or
when the rooster crows
or
morning
lest
having come
suddenly
he should find
you
sleeping
What
now
to you
I say
to all
I say
Watch
It would be
now
the
Passover
and
the
[Feast of] Unleavened Bread
after
two
days
And
were seeking
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
how
Him
by
stealth
having taken
they might kill [Him]
They were saying
for
Not
during
the
feast
lest
ever
there will be
an uproar
of the
people
And
being
of Him
in
Bethany
in
the
house
of Simon
the
leper
having reclined
of Him
came
a woman
having
an alabaster flask
of fragrant oil
of nard
pure
of great price
having broken
the
alabaster flask
she poured [it] on
His
-
head
Were
now
some
indignant
within
themselves
To
what
the
waste
this
of the
fragrant oil
has been made
Could
for
this
-
fragrant oil
to have been sold
for above
denarii
three hundred
and
to have been given
to the
poor
And
they were grumbling
at her
-
And
Jesus
said
Leave alone
her
why
to her
trouble
do you cause
A good
work
she did
toward
Me
Always
for
the
poor
you have
with
you
and
whenever
you desire
you are able
them
good
to do
Me
however
not
always
do you have
What
she could
she did
She came beforehand
to anoint
the
body
of Me
for
the
burial
Truly
now
I say
to you
wherever
if
shall be proclaimed
the
gospel
in
whole
the
world
also
what
has done
this [woman]
will be spoken of
for
a memorial
of her
And
Judas
Iscariot
-
one
of the
Twelve
went away
to
the
chief priests
that
Him
he might betray
to them
-
And
having heard
they rejoiced
and
promised
him
money
to give
And
he was seeking
how
Him
conveniently
he might deliver up
And
on the
first
day
-
of unleavened [bread]
when
the
Passover lamb
they were to sacrifice
say
to Him
the
disciples
of Him
Where
do You desire [that]
having gone
we should prepare
that
You may eat
the
Passover
And
He sends forth
two
of the
disciples
of Him
and
says
to them
Go
into
the
city
and
will meet
you
a man
a pitcher
of water
carrying
Follow
him
And
wherever
if
he might enter
say
to the
master of the house
that
the
Teacher
says
Where
is
the
guest room
of Me
where
the
Passover
with
the
disciples
of Me
I may eat
And
he
you
will show
an upper room
large
having been furnished
[and] ready
And
there
prepare
for us
And
went away
-
his disciples
and
came
into
the
city
and
found
as
He had said
to them
and
they prepared
the
Passover
And
evening
having arrived
He comes
with
the
Twelve
And
as were reclining
they
and
were eating
-
Jesus
said
Truly
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
Me
who
is eating
with
Me
They began
to be grieved
and
to say
to Him
one
by
one
Surely not
I
-
And
He said
to them
[It is] one of
the
Twelve
who
is dipping
with
Me
in
the
bowl
For
-
indeed
the Son
-
of Man
goes
as
it has been written
concerning
Him
woe
however
to the
man
that
by
whom
the
Son
-
of Man
is betrayed
better
for him [it were]
if
not
had been born
the
man
that
And
they were eating
of them
having taken
bread
having spoken a blessing
He broke
and
gave
to them
and
said
Take
this
is
the
body
of Me
And
having taken
the cup
having given thanks
He gave [it]
to them
and
they drank
of
it
all
And
He said
to them
This
is
the
blood
of Me
of the
covenant
which
is being poured out
for
many
Truly
I say
to you
that
no more
never
not
will I drink
of
the
fruit
of the
vine
until
the
day
that
when
it
I drink
anew
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
having sung a hymn
they went out
to
the
Mount
-
of Olives
And
says
to them
-
Jesus
-
All
you will fall away
for
it has been written
I will strike
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
will be scattered
But
after
-
having arisen
I
will go before
you
into
-
Galilee
-
And
Peter
was saying
to Him
If
even
all
will fall away
yet
not
I
And
says
to him
-
Jesus
Truly
I say
to you
that
yourself
now
this
-
night
before
that
twice
[the] rooster
crows
three times
Me
you will deny
-
And
emphatically
he kept saying
If
it is needful
of me
to die with
You
no
not
You
will I deny
Likewise
now
also
all
of them were saying
And
they come
to
a place
of which
the
name [is]
Gethsemane
and
He says
to the
disciples
of Him
Sit
here
while
I shall pray
And
He takes
-
Peter
and
-
James
and
-
John
with
Him
and
He began
to be greatly awe-struck
and
deeply distressed
And
He says
to them
Very sorrowful
is
the
soul
of Me
even to
death
remain
here
and
watch
And
having gone forward
a little
He fell
upon
the
ground
and
was praying
that
if
possible
it is
might pass
from
Him
the
hour
And
He was saying
Abba
-
Father
all things [are]
possible
to You
take away
the
cup
this
from
Me
but
not
what
I
will
but
what
You
And
He comes
and
finds
them
sleeping
And
He says
-
to Peter
Simon
are you asleep
Not
were you able
one
hour
to watch
Watch
and
pray
so that
not
you may enter
into
temptation
The
indeed
spirit
[is] willing
-
but
the flesh
weak
And
again
having gone away
He prayed
the
same
thing
having said
And
again
having returned
he found
them
sleeping
Were
for
of them
the
eyes
heavy
and
not
they knew
what
they should answer
Him
And
He comes
the
third time
and
says
to them
Are you sleeping
-
still
and
taking your rest
It is enough
has come
the
hour
behold
is delivered up
the
Son
-
of Man
into
the
hands
of the
sinful
Rise
let us go
behold
the [one]
betraying
Me
has drawn near
And
immediately
while yet
of Him
speaking
comes up
-
Judas
one
of the
Twelve
and
with
Him
a crowd
with
swords
and
clubs
from
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
Had given
then
the [one]
delivering up
Him
a sign
to them
saying
Whomever
-
I shall kiss
He
is
seize
Him
and
lead [Him] away
securely
And
having arrived
immediately
having come up
to Him
he says
Rabbi
And
he kissed
Him
-
And
they laid
the
hands
on Him
and
seized
Him
One
then
a certain
of those
standing by
having drawn
the
sword
struck
the
servant
of the
high priest
and
cut off
of him
the
ear
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to them
As
against
a robber
are you come out
with
swords
and
clubs
to capture
Me
Every
day
I was
with
you
in
the
temple
teaching
and
not
you did seize
Me
But [it is]
that
may be fulfilled
the
Scriptures
And
having left
Him
fled
all
And
[a] young man
certain
was following
Him
having cast
a linen cloth
about
[his] naked [body]
and
they seize
him
-
and
having left behind
the
linen cloth
naked
he fled
And
they led away
-
Jesus
to
the
high priest
And
come together
all
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
And
-
Peter
from
afar off
followed
Him
as far as
within
to
the
court
of the
high priest
and
he was
sitting
with
the
officers
and
warming himself
at
the
fire
-
And
the chief priests
and
all
the
Council
were seeking
against
-
Jesus
testimony
to
-
put to death
Him
but
not
they were finding [any]
Many
for
were bearing false testimony
against
Him
but
alike
their
testimonies
not
were
And
some
having risen up
were bearing false testimony
against
Him
saying
-
We
heard
Him
saying
-
I
will destroy
the
temple
this
the [one]
made with hands
and
in
three
days
another
not made with hands
I will build
And
neither
thus
alike
was
the
testimony
of them
And
having stood up
the
high priest
in
the midst
he questioned
-
Jesus
saying
Not
answer You
nothing
What [is it]
these
You
testify against
-
But
He was silent
and
not
did He answer
nothing
Again
the
high priest
was questioning
Him
and
says
to Him
You
are
the
Christ
the
Son
of the
Blessed [One]
-
And
Jesus
said
I
am
And
you will see
the
Son
-
of Man
at [the]
right hand
sitting
of
Power
and
coming
with
the
clouds
of
heaven
-
And
the high priest
having torn
the
garments
of him
says
What
any more
need
have we
of witnesses
You heard
the
blasphemy
What
to you
does it appear
-
And
all
condemned
Him
deserving
to be
of death
And
began
some
to spit upon
Him
and
to cover up
of Him
the
face
and
to strike
Him
and
to say
to Him
Prophesy
And
the
officers
with the palms
Him
received
And
being
-
Peter
below
in
the
courtyard
comes
one
of the
servant girls
of the
high priest
and
having seen
-
Peter
warming himself
having looked at
him
she says
Also
you
with
the
Nazarene
were
-
Jesus
-
But
he denied [it]
saying
Neither
I know
nor even
understand
you
what
say
And
he went forth
out
into
the
porch
And
the
servant girl
having seen
him
began
again
to say
to those
standing by
-
This
[one] of
them
is
-
But
again
he denied
And
after
a little
again
those
standing by
were saying
-
to Peter
Truly
of
them
you are
also
for
a Galilean
you are
-
But
he began
to curse
and
to swear
-
Not
I know
the
man
this
whom
you speak of
And
immediately
for
the second time
a rooster
crowed
And
remembered
-
Peter
the
word
that
had said
to him
-
Jesus
-
Before
[the] rooster
twice
crows
three times
Me
you will deny
And
having broken down
he began to weep
And
early
in the morning
a counsel
having formed
the
chief priests
with
the
elders
and
scribes
and
all
the
Council
having bound
-
Jesus
they led [Him] away
and
delivered [Him]
to Pilate
And
questioned
Him
-
Pilate
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
-
And
answering
to him
He says
You
have said
And
were accusing
Him
the
chief priests
of many things
-
And
Pilate
again
began to question
Him
saying
Not
answer You
nothing
See
how many things
You
they testify against
-
But
Jesus
no longer
nothing
answered
so as
to amaze
-
Pilate
At
then
[the] feast
he used to release
to them
one
prisoner
whom
they requested
There was
then
the [one]
called
Barabbas
with
the
rebels
having been bound
who
in
the
insurrection
murder
had committed
And
having cried out
the
crowd
began
to beg [him to do]
as usually
he did
for them
-
But
Pilate
answered
them
saying
Wish you [that]
I should release
to you
the
King
of the
Jews
He was aware
for
that
because of
envy
had delivered up
Him
the
chief priests
-
But
the chief priests
stirred up
the
crowd
so that
instead
-
Barabbas
he might release
to them
-
And
Pilate
again
answering
was saying
to them
What
then
I should do
to Him
you call
the
King
of the
Jews
-
And
again
they cried out
Crucify
Him
-
And
Pilate
was saying
to them
What
indeed
did He commit
evil
-
But
much more
they shouted
Crucify
Him
-
And
Pilate
desiring
to the
crowd
that which [was]
satisfactory
to do
released
to them
-
Barabbas
and
he delivered
-
Jesus
having flogged [him]
that
He might be crucified
-
And
the soldiers
led away
him
into
the
palace
that
is
[the] Praetorium
and
they call together
all
the
cohort
And
they put on
Him
purple
and
placed on
Him
having twisted together
of thorns
a crown
and
they began
to salute
Him
Hail
King
of the
Jews
And
they kept striking
His
-
head
with a reed
and
spitting on
Him
and
bending
the
knees
they were kneeling down
to Him
And
when
they had mocked
Him
they took off
him
the
purple
and
put on
Him
the
garments
His
And
they are leading out
him
that
they might crucify
Him
And
they compel
passing by
one
Simon
of Cyrene
coming
from
the country
the
father
of Alexander
and
Rufus
that
he might carry
the
cross
of Him
And
they bring
Him
to
-
Golgotha
a place
which
is
translated
of a Skull
Place
And
they were offering
Him
having been mixed with myrrh
wine
He
however
not
did take [it]
And
having crucified
Him
also
they divided
the
garments
of Him
casting
lots
for
them
who
what
should take
It was
then
[the] hour
third
and
they crucified
Him
And
there was
the
inscription
of the
accusation
against Him
having been written
The
King
of the
Jews
And
with
Him
they crucify
two
robbers
one
at
[the] right hand
and
one
at [the]
left
of Him
And
those
passing by
were railing at
Him
shaking
the
heads
of them
and
saying
Aha
The [One]
destroying
the
temple
and
building [it]
in
three
days
save
Yourself
having descended
from
the
cross
Likewise
also
the
chief priests
mocking
among
one another
with
the
scribes
were saying
Others
He saved
Himself
not
He is able
to save
The
Christ
the
King
of Israel
let Him descend
now
from
the
cross
that
we might see
and
believe
And
those
being crucified
with
Him
were upbraiding
Him
And
having arrived
[the] hour
sixth
darkness
came
over
all
the
land
until
[the] hour
ninth
And
at the
ninth
hour
cried out
-
Jesus
in a voice
loud
Eloi
Eloi
lema
sabachthani
Which
is
translated
-
God
of Me
-
God
of Me
to
why
have You forsaken
Me
And
some
of those
standing by
having heard
were saying
Behold
Elijah
He calls
Having run
then
one
and
having filled
a sponge
with vinegar
having put [it] on
a reed
gave to drink
him
saying
Let be
let us see
if
comes
Elijah
to take down
him
-
But
Jesus
having uttered
a cry
loud
breathed His last
And
the
veil
of the
temple
was torn
into
two
from
top
to
bottom
Having seen
then
the
centurion
-
standing
from
opposite of
Him
that
thus
He breathed His last
he said
Truly
this
-
man
[the] Son
of God
was
There were
then
also
women
from
afar off
looking on
among
whom
also
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
Mary
the
of James
the
least
and
of Joseph
mother
and
Salome
who
when
He was
in
-
Galilee
had been following
Him
and
had been ministering
to Him
and
other
many
those
having come up with
Him
to
Jerusalem
And
already
evening
having arrived
since
it was [the]
Preparation
that
is
the day before Sabbath
having come
Joseph
-
from
Arimathea
a prominent
Council member
who
also
himself
was
waiting for
the
kingdom
-
of God
having boldness
went in
to
-
Pilate
and
asked for
the
body
-
of Jesus
-
And
Pilate
wondered
if
already
He were dead
And
having called to [him]
the
centurion
he questioned
him
whether
already
He had died
And
having known [it]
from
the
centurion
He granted
the
body
-
to Joseph
And
having bought
a linen cloth
having taken down
him
he wrapped [Him] in
the
linen cloth
and
laid
Him
in
a tomb
which
was
cut
out of
a rock
And
he rolled
a stone
to
the
door
of the
tomb
-
And
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
Mary
the [mother]
of Joseph
were watching
where
He was laid
And
having passed
the
Sabbath
Mary
-
Magdalene
and
Mary
the [mother]
-
of James
and
Salome
bought
spices
that
having come
they might anoint
Him
And
very
early
on the
first [day]
of the
week
they come
to
the
tomb
having arisen
the
sun
And
they were saying
among
themselves
Who
will roll away
for us
the
stone
from
the
door
of the
tomb
And
having looked up
they see
that
has been rolled away
the
stone
it was
for
large
extremely
And
having entered
into
the
tomb
they saw
a young man
sitting
on
the
right
clothed in
a robe
white
and
they were greatly amazed
-
And
he says
to them
Not
be amazed
Jesus
you seek
the
Nazarene
the [One]
having been crucified
He is risen
Not
He is
here
Behold
the
place
where
they laid
Him
But
go
say
the
disciples
of Him
and
-
to Peter
that
He goes before
you
into
-
Galilee
there
Him
will you see
as
He said
to you
And
having gone out
they fled
from
the
tomb
Had seized
for
them
trembling
and
amazement
and
to none
nothing
they spoke
they were afraid
for
Having risen
now
early [the]
first [day]
of the week
He appeared
first
to Mary
-
Magdalene
from
whom
He had cast out
seven
demons
She
having gone
told [it]
to those
with
Him
having been
mourning
and
weeping
And they
having heard
that
He is alive
and
has been seen
by
her
disbelieved
After
now
these things
to two
of
them
as they are walking
He appeared
in
another
form
going
into
[the] country
And they
having gone
told [it]
to the
rest
neither
them
did they believe
Afterward
now
were reclining
they
to the
eleven
He appeared
and
rebuked
the
unbelief
of them
and
hardness of heart
because
those
having seen
Him
arisen
not
they believed
And
He said
to them
Having gone
into
the
world
all
proclaim
the
gospel
to all
the
creation
The [one]
having believed
and
having been baptized
will be saved
the [one]
however
having disbelieved
will be condemned
Signs
now
those
having believed
these
will accompany
In
the
name
of Me
demons
they will cast out
with tongues
they will speak
new
serpents
they will take up
and if
deadly
anything
they drink
no
not
them
shall it hurt
upon
[the] sick
hands
they will lay
and
well
they will be
-
Indeed
therefore
the Lord
Jesus
after
-
speaking
to them
was taken up
into
the
heaven
and
sat
at [the]
right hand
-
of God
They
now
having gone forth
preached
everywhere
the
Lord
working with [them]
and
the
word
confirming
by
the
accompanying
signs

































Inasmuch as
many
have undertaken
to draw up
a narration
concerning
the
having been accomplished
among
us
things
as
delivered [them]
to us
those
from
[the] beginning
eyewitnesses
and
servants
having been
of the
word
it seemed good
also to me
having been acquainted
from the first
with all things
carefully
with method
to you
to write
most excellent
Theophilus
so that
you may know
concerning
which
you were instructed
[of the] things
the
certainty
There was
in
the
days
of Herod
king
-
of Judea
a priest
certain
named
Zechariah
of [the]
division
of Abijah
and
wife
of him
of
the
daughters
of Aaron
and
the
name
of her
Elizabeth
They were
now
righteous
both
before
-
God
walking
in
all
the
commandments
and
ordinances
of the
Lord
blameless
And
no
there was
to them
child
inasmuch as
was
-
Elizabeth
barren
and
both
advanced
in
the
years
of them
were
It came to pass
now
in
the
fulfilling the priestly service
of him
in
the
order
of the
division
of him
before
-
God
according to
the
custom
of the
priesthood
it fell to him by lot
-
to burn incense
having entered
into
the
temple
of the
Lord
And
all
the
multitude
were
of the
people
praying
outside
at the
hour
of the
incense
Appeared
then
to him
an angel
of [the] Lord
standing
at
[the] right
of the
altar
of the
incense
And
was troubled
Zechariah
having seen [him]
and
fear
fell
upon
him
Said
then
to
him
the
angel
Not
fear
Zechariah
because
has been heard
the
prayer
of you
and
the
wife
of You
Elizabeth
will bear
a son
to you
and
you shall call
the
name
of him
John
And
he will be
joy
to you
and
gladness
and
many
at
the
birth
of him
will rejoice
He will be
for
great
before
Lord
and
wine
and
strong drink
no
not
shall he drink
and
[of the] Spirit
Holy
he will be filled
even
from
[the] womb
of [the] mother
of him
And
many
of the
sons
of Israel
he will turn
to
[the] Lord
the
God
of them
And
he
will go forth
before
Him
in
[the] spirit
and
power
of Elijah
to turn
[the] hearts
of [the] fathers
to
[the] children
and
[the] disobedient
to
[the] wisdom
of [the] righteous
to make ready
for [the] Lord
a people
prepared
And
said
Zechariah
to
the
angel
By
what
will I know
this
I
for
am
an old man
and
the
wife
of me
is advanced
in
the
years
of her
And
answering
the
angel
said
to him
I
am
Gabriel
the [one]
standing
before
-
God
and
I was sent
to speak
to
you
and
to bring glad tidings
to you
these
And
behold
you will be
silent
and
not
able
to speak
until
that
day
shall take place
these things
in return for
that
not
you did believe
the
words
of me
which
will be fulfilled
in
the
season
of them
And
were
the
people
expecting
-
Zechariah
and
they were wondering
at
the
delaying
in
the
temple
of him
Having come out
then
not
he was able
to speak
to them
and
they recognized
that
a vision
he had seen
in
the
temple
And
he
was
making signs
to them
and
remained
mute
And
it came to pass
when
were fulfilled
the
days
of the
service
of him
he departed
to
the
home
of him
After
then
these
-
days
conceived
Elizabeth
the
wife
of him
and
hid
herself
months
five
saying
-
Thus
to me
has done
the Lord
in
[the] days
in which
He looked upon [me]
to take away
[the] disgrace
of me
among
men
In
now
the
month
-
sixth
was sent
the
angel
Gabriel
by
-
God
to
a city
-
of Galilee
whose
name [was]
Nazareth
to
a virgin
betrothed
to a man
whose
name [was]
Joseph
of
[the] house
of David
and
the
name
of the
virgin
[was] Mary
And
having come
to
her
he said
Greetings
[you] favored with grace
The
Lord [is]
with
you
-
And
at
the
statement
she was troubled
and
was pondering
what kind
might be
the
salutation
this
And
said
the
angel
to her
Not
fear
Mary
you have found
for
favor
with
-
God
and
behold
you will conceive
in
womb
and
will bring forth
a son
and
you shall call
the
name
of Him
Jesus
He
will be
great
and
Son
of [the] Most High
He will be called
and
will give
Him
[the] Lord
-
God
the
throne
of David
of the
father
of Him
and
He will reign
over
the
house
of Jacob
to
the
ages
and
of the
kingdom
of Him
not
there will be
an end
Said
then
Mary
to
the
angel
How
will be
this
since
a man
not
I know
And
answering
the
angel
said
to her
[the] Spirit
Holy
will come
upon
you
and
power
of [the] Most High
will overshadow
you
therefore
also
the
being born
Holy [One]
will be called
[the] Son
of God
And
behold
Elizabeth
the
relative
of you
also
she
has conceived
a son
in
old age
her
and
this
month
[the] sixth
is
to her
who
[was] called
barren
For
not
will be impossible
with
-
God
every
thing
Said
then
Mary
Behold
the
handmaid
of [the] Lord
May it happen
to me
according to
the
word
of you
And
departed
from
her
the
angel
Having risen up
then
Mary
in
the
days
this
she went
into
the
hill country
with
haste
to
a town
of Judah
and
she entered
into
the
house
of Zechariah
and
greeted
-
Elizabeth
And
it came to pass
as
heard
the
greeting
-
of Mary
-
Elizabeth
leaped
the
baby
in
the
womb
of her
and
was filled
with [the] Spirit
Holy
-
Elizabeth
and
she cried out
in a voice
loud
and
said
Blessed are
you
among
women
and
blessed is
the
fruit
of the
womb
of you
And
from where
to me
this
that
should come
the
mother
of the
Lord
of me
to
me
Behold
for
as
came
the
voice
of the
greeting
of you
into
the
ears
of me
leaped
in
exultation
the
baby
in
the
womb
of me
And
blessed [is]
the [one]
having believed
that
there will be
a fulfillment
to the things
spoken
to her
from
[the] Lord
And
said
Mary
Magnifies
the
soul
of Me
the
Lord
and
rejoices
the
spirit
of me
in
-
God
the
Savior
of me
For
He has looked
upon
the
humiliation
of the
handmaiden
of Him
Behold
for
from
-
henceforth
will count blessed
me
all
the
generations
For
has done
to me
great things
the
Mighty One
And
holy [is]
the
name
of Him
And
the
mercy
of Him
[is] to
generations
and
generations
to those
fearing
Him
He has shown
strength
with
the arm
of Him
He has scattered
[the] proud
in [the] thought
of heart
of them
He has brought down
rulers
from
thrones
and
exalted
[the] humble
[Those] hungering
He has filled
with good things
and
[those] being rich
He has sent away
empty
He has helped
Israel
[the] servant
of Him
remembering
mercy
as
He spoke
to
the
fathers
of us
-
to Abraham
and
to the
descendants
of him
to
the
age
Dwelt
then
Mary
with
her
about
months
three
and
returned
to
the
home
of her
To
now
Elizabeth
was fulfilled
the
time
-
to give birth
for her
and
she bore
a son
And
heard
the
neighbors
and
-
relatives
of her
that
was magnifying
[the] Lord
the
mercy
of Him
with
her
and
they were rejoicing with
her
And
it came to pass
on
-
day
the
eighth
they came
to circumcise
the
child
and
were calling
it
after
the
name
of the
father
of him
Zechariah
And
answering
the
mother
of him
said
No
but
he will be called
John
And
they said
to
her
-
No one
is
among
the
relatives
of you
who
is called
the
name
by this
They were making signs
then
to the
father
of him
the
what
-
he might wish
to be called
him
And
having asked for
a writing tablet
he wrote
saying
John
is
[the] name
of him
And
they marveled
all
Was opened
then
the
mouth
of him
immediately
and
the
tongue
of him
and
he was speaking
blessing
-
God
And
came
upon
all
fear
those
dwelling around
them
and
in
all
the
hill country
-
of Judea
were being talked about
all
the things
words
these
And
laid [them] up
all
those
having heard
in
the
heart
of them
saying
What
then
the
child
this
will be
And
for
[the] hand
of [the] Lord
was
with
him
And
Zechariah
the
father
of him
was filled
with [the] Spirit
Holy
and
prophesied
saying
Blessed be
[the] Lord
the
God
-
of Israel
because
He has visited
and
has performed
redemption
[on] the
people
of Him
and
has raised up
a horn
of salvation
for us
in
[the] house
of David
of [the] servant
of Him
as
He spoke
by
[the] mouth
of the
holy
of
old
prophets
of Him
salvation
from
[the] enemies
of us
and
from
[the] hand
of all
those
hating
us
to fulfill
mercy
toward
the
fathers
of us
and
to remember
[the] covenant
holy
of Him
[the] oath
that
He swore
to
Abraham
the
father
of us
-
to grant
us
without fear
from
[the] hand
of our enemies
having been saved
to serve
Him
in
holiness
and
righteousness
before
Him
all
the
days
of our life
And
you
now
child
prophet
of [the] Most High
will be called
you will go
for
before
the Lord
to prepare
ways
of Him
-
to give
knowledge
of salvation
to
people
of Him
in
forgiveness
of [the] sins
of them
through
[the] affections
of compassion
of God
of us
in
which
will visit
us
[the] Sunrise
from
on high
to shine upon
those
in
darkness
and
in [the] shadow
of death
sitting
-
to direct
the
feet
of us
into
[the] way
of peace
-
And
the child
continued to grow
and
was strengthened
in spirit
and
he was
in
the
deserted places
until
[the] day
of appearance
of him
to
-
Israel
It came to pass
then
in
the
days
those
went out
a decree
from
Caesar
Augustus
to register
all
the
world
This
registration
first
took place [when]
was governing
-
Syria
Quirinius
And
were going
all
to be registered
each
to
the
of themselves
city
Went up
then
also
Joseph
from
-
Galilee
out of
[the] town
of Nazareth
to
-
Judea
to
[the] City
of David
which
is called
Bethlehem
because of
-
being
his
of
[the] house
and
family
of David
to register
with
Mary
the [one]
being betrothed
to him
she being
with child
It came to pass
then
in
their
being
-
there
were fulfilled
the
days
of the
giving birth
of her
And
she brought forth
the
son
of her
the
firstborn
and
wrapped in swaddling cloths
him
and
laid
Him
in
a manger
because
not
there was
for them
a place
in
the
inn
And
shepherds
were
in
the
region
-
same
lodging in the fields
and
keeping
watch
-
by night
over
the
flock
of them
And
an angel
of [the] Lord
stood by
them
and
[the] glory
of [the] Lord
shone around
them
and
they feared
[with] fear
great
And
said
to them
the
angel
Not
fear
behold
for
I bring good news
to you
[of] joy
great
which
will be
to all
the
people
For
has been born
to you
today
a Savior
who
is
Christ
[the] Lord
in
[the] City
of David
And
this [is]
to you
sign
You will find
a baby
wrapped in swaddling cloths
and
lying
in
a manger
And
suddenly
there came
with
the
angel
a multitude
of [the] host
heavenly
praising
-
God
and
saying
Glory
in
[the] highest
to God
and
on
earth
peace
among
men
with whom He is pleased
And
it came to pass
as
were departing
from
them
into
the
heaven
the
angels
the
shepherds
were saying
to
one another
Let us go through
indeed
as far as
Bethlehem
and
let us see
the
word
this
that
has come to pass
which
the
Lord
has made known
to us
And
they came
having hurried
and
found
-
both
Mary
and
-
Joseph
and
the
baby
lying
in
the
manger
Having seen
now
they proclaimed abroad
concerning
the
saying
-
having been told
them
concerning
the
Child
this
And
all
those
having heard
marveled
concerning
the things
having been spoken
by
the
shepherds
to
them
-
But
Mary
all
was treasuring up
-
matters
these
pondering [them]
in
the
heart
of her
And
returned
the
shepherds
glorifying
and
praising
-
God
for
all things
which
they had heard
and
seen
as
it was said
to
them
And
when
were fulfilled
days
eight
-
to circumcise
Him
then
was called
the
name
of Him
Jesus
which
He had been called
by
the
angel
before
-
was conceived
He
in
the
womb
And
when
were fulfilled
the
days
of the
purification
of them
according to
the
law
of Moses
they brought
Him
to
Jerusalem
to present
to the
Lord
as
it has been written
in [the]
law
of [the] Lord
-
Every
male
opening
a womb
holy
to the
Lord
shall be called
and
-
to offer
a sacrifice
according to
that
having been said
in
the
law
of [the] Lord
A pair
of turtle doves
or
two
young
pigeons
And
behold
a man
there was
in
Jerusalem
whose
name [was]
Simeon
and
the
man
this
[was] righteous
and
devout
waiting for
[the] consolation
-
of Israel
and
[the] Spirit
was
Holy
upon
him
And
it was
to him
divinely revealed
by
the
Spirit
-
Holy
not
to see
death
before
that
-
he should see
the
Christ
of [the] Lord
And
he came
in
the
Spirit
into
the
temple
and
in
the [time when]
were bringing in
the
parents
the
child
Jesus
the [thing]
were doing
they
according to
that
having become customary
by the
law
for
Him
then
he
received
Him
into
the
arms
and
blessed
-
God
and
said
Now
You dismiss
the
servant
of You
Lord
according to
the
word
of You
in
peace
for
have seen
the
eyes
of me
the
salvation
of You
which
You have prepared
before
[the] face
of all
the
peoples
a light
for
revelation
of [the] Gentiles
and
glory
of [the] people
of You
Israel
And
were
the
father
of Him
and
the
mother
marveling
at
the things
having been spoken
concerning
Him
And
blessed
them
Simeon
and
said
to
Mary
the
mother
of Him
Behold
this [Child]
is appointed
for
[the] falling
and
rising up
of many
in
-
Israel
and
for
a sign
spoken against
and
of you
also
of her
the
soul
will go through
a sword
so that
-
may be revealed
of
many
hearts
[the] thoughts
And
there was
Anna
a prophetess
daughter
of Phanuel
of
[the] tribe
of Asher
she
being advanced
in
years
great
having lived
with
a husband
years
seven
from
the
marriage
of herself
and
she
[was] a widow
of about
years
eighty [and]
four
who
not
departed
the
temple
with fastings
and
prayers
serving
night
and
day
And
she
at that
hour
having come up
was giving praise
-
to God
and
was speaking
concerning
Him
to all
those
waiting for
[the] redemption
of Jerusalem
And
when
they had performed
everything
-
according to
the
law
of [the] Lord
they returned
to
-
Galilee
to the
town
of them
Nazareth
-
And
the Child
continued to grow
and
become strong
being filled
with wisdom
and
[the] grace
of God
was
upon
Him
And
were going
the
parents
of Him
every
year
to
Jerusalem
at the
feast
of the
Passover
And
when
He was
years [old]
twelve
having gone up
they
according to
the
custom
of the
Feast
and
having completed
the
days
in
the
returning
of them
remained behind
Jesus
the
boy
in
Jerusalem
But
not
knew
the
parents
of Him
Having supposed
now
Him
to be
in
their
company
they went
a dayâs
journey
and
began seeking
Him
among
the
relatives
and
the
acquaintances
and
not
having found [Him]
they returned
to
Jerusalem
seeking
Him
And
it came to pass
after
days
three
they found
Him
in
the
temple
sitting
in
[the] midst
of the
teachers
both
hearing
them
and
questioning
them
Were amazed
then
all
those
hearing
Him
at
the
understanding
and
the
answers
of Him
And
having seen
Him
they were astonished
and
said
to
Him
the
mother
of Him
Child
why
have You done
to us
thus
Behold
the
father
of You
and I
distressing
were seeking
You
And
He said
to
them
Why [is it]
that
you were seeking
Me
Not
knew you
that
in
the [house]
of the
Father
of Me
it behooves
to be
Me
And
they
not
understood
the
word
that
He spoke
to them
And
He went down
with
them
and
came
to
Nazareth
and
He was
subject
to them
And
the
mother
of Him
was treasuring up
all
the
matters
in
the
heart
of her
And
Jesus
continued to advance
in
-
wisdom
and
stature
and
in favor
with
God
and
men
In
year
then
fifteenth
of the
reign
of Tiberius
Caesar
being governor
Pontius
Pilate
-
of Judea
and
being tetrarch
-
of Galilee
Herod
Philip
now
the
brother
of him
being tetrarch
-
of Ituraea
and
of Trachonitis
[the] region
and
Lysanias
-
of Abilene
being tetrarch
during
[the] high priesthood
of Annas
and
Caiaphas
came
[the] word
of God
upon
John
-
of Zechariah
son
in
the
wilderness
And
he went
into
all
the
surrounding region
of the
Jordan
proclaiming
a baptism
of repentance
for
forgiveness
of sins
as
it has been written
in
[the] book
of [the] words
of Isaiah
the
prophet
[The] voice
of one crying
in
the
wilderness
Prepare
the
way
of [the] Lord
straight
make
the
paths
of Him
Every
valley
will be filled
and
every
mountain
and
hill
will be made low
and
will become
the
crooked
into
straight
and
the
rough
into
ways
smooth
and
will see
all
flesh
the
salvation
-
of God
He was saying
therefore
to the
coming out
crowds
to be baptized
by
him
Offspring
of vipers
who
forewarned
you
to flee
from
the
coming
wrath
Produce
therefore
fruits
worthy
-
of repentance
and
not
begin
to say
in
yourselves
[As] father
We have
-
Abraham
I say
for
to you
that
is able
-
God
from
-
stones
these
to raise up
children
-
to Abraham
Already
now
also
the
ax
to
the
root
of the
trees
is applied
every
therefore
tree
not
producing
fruit
good
is cut down
and
into
[the] fire
is thrown
And
were asking
him
the
crowds
saying
What
then
shall we do
Answering
now
he was saying
to them
The [one]
having
two
tunics
let him impart
to the [one]
none
having
and
the [one]
having
food
likewise
let him do
Came
then
also
tax collectors
to be baptized
and
they said
to
him
Teacher
what
shall we do
-
And
he said
to
them
Nothing
more
beyond
that
having been appointed
to you
collect
Were asking
then
him
also
those being soldiers
saying
What
shall do
also
we
And
he said
to them
No one
extort
nor
accuse falsely
and
be content with
the
wages
of you
Are expecting
then
the
people
and
wondering
all
in
the
hearts
of them
concerning
-
John
whether
ever
he
might be
the
Christ
Answered
saying
[to] all
-
John
I
indeed
with water
baptize
you
comes
however
the [One]
mightier
than I
of whom
not
I am
worthy
to untie
the
strap
of the
sandals
of Him
He
you
will baptize
with
[the] Spirit
Holy
and
with fire
of whom
the
winnowing fork [is]
in
the
hand
of Him
to clear
the
threshing floor
of Him
and
to gather
the
wheat
into
the
barn
of Him
-
But
the chaff
He will burn up
with fire
unquenchable
Many
indeed
therefore
other
things
exhorting
he was preaching the good news to
the
people
-
And
Herod
the
tetrarch
being reproved
by
him
concerning
Herodias
the
wife
of the
brother
of him
and
concerning
all
that
had done
[the] evils
-
Herod
added
yet
this
to
all
he locked up
-
John
in
prison
It came to pass
now
in
-
having been baptized
all
the
people
and
Jesus
having been baptized
and
having prayed
was opened
the
heaven
and
descended
the
Spirit
-
Holy
in a bodily
form
as
a dove
upon
Him
and
a voice
out of
heaven
came
You
are
the
Son
of Me
the
beloved
in
You
I am well pleased
And
Himself

Jesus
then
full
of [the] Spirit
Holy
returned
from
the
Jordan
and
was led
by
the
Spirit
into
the
wilderness
days
forty
being tempted
by
the
devil
And
not
He ate
nothing
in
the
days
those
and
having ended
they
He was hungry
Said
then
to Him
the
devil
If
[the] Son
You are
-
of God
speak
to the
stone
this
that
it should become
bread
And
answered
to
him
-
Jesus
It has been written
-
Not
on
bread
alone
shall live
the
man
And
having led up
Him
he showed
Him
all
the
kingdoms
of the
world
in
a moment
of time
And
said
to Him
the
devil
To You
will I give
the
authority
this
all
and
the
glory
of it
for
to me
it has been delivered
and
to whom
if
I wish
I give
it
You
therefore
if
You will worship
before
me
will be
Yours
all
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to him
It has been written
You shall worship
[the] Lord
-
God
of You
and
Him
only
you shall serve
He led
also
Him
to
Jerusalem
and
set
upon
the
pinnacle
of the
temple
and
said
to Him
If
[the] Son
You are
-
of God
cast
Yourself
from here
down
It has been written
for
-
To the
angels
of Him
He will give orders
concerning
You
-
to guard
You
and
-
in
[their] hands
will they bear
You
lest
ever
You strike
against
a stone
the
foot
of You
And
answering
said
to him
-
Jesus
-
It has been said
Not
you shall test
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
And
having finished
every
temptation
the
devil
departed
from
Him
until
an opportune time
And
returned
-
Jesus
in
the
power
of the
Spirit
to
-
Galilee
and
a report
went out
into
all
the
surrounding region
concerning
Him
And
He
was teaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
being glorified
by
all
And
He came
to
Nazareth
where
He had been
brought up
and
He entered
according to
the
custom
to Him
on
the
day
of the
Sabbaths
into
the
synagogue
and
stood up
to read
And
there was given
to Him
[the] scroll of
the
prophet
Isaiah
and
having unrolled
the
scroll
He found
the
place
where
it was
written
[The] Spirit
of [the] Lord [is]
upon
Me
of which
because
He has anointed
Me
to preach good news
to [the] poor
He has sent
Me
to proclaim
to [the] captives
deliverance
and
to [the] blind
recovery of sight
to send forth
[the] oppressed
in
deliverance
to proclaim
[the] year
of [the] Lordâs
favor
And
having rolled up
the
scroll
having delivered [it]
to the
attendant
He sat down
and
of all
the
eyes
in
the
synagogue
were
fixed upon
Him
He began
then
to say
to
them
-
Today
is fulfilled
the
Scripture
this
in
the
hearing
of you
And
all
were bearing witness
to Him
and
marveling
at
the
words
of the
grace
that
are proceeding
out of
the
mouth
of Him
and
they were saying
Not
the son
is
of Joseph
this
And
He said
to
them
Surely
you will say
to Me
the
proverb
this
Physician
heal
yourself
Whatsoever
we have heard
has been done
in
-
Capernaum
do
also
here
in
the
hometown
of You
He said
then
Truly
I say
to you
that
no
prophet
acceptable
is
in
the
hometown
of him
In
truth
now
I say
to you
many
widows
there were
in
the
days
of Elijah
in
-
Israel
when
was shut up
the
heaven
for
years
three
and
months
six
when
there was
a famine
great
upon
all
the
land
and
to
none
of them
was sent
Elijah
if
not
to
Zarephath
-
of Sidon
to
a woman
a widow
And
many
lepers
were
in
-
Israel
in the time
of Elisha
the
prophet
and
none
of them
was cleansed
if
not
Naaman
the
Syrian
And
were filled
all
with anger
in
the
synagogue
hearing
these things
and
having risen up
they cast
Him
out
of [the]
city
and
led
Him
unto
brow
of the
hill
upon
which
the
town
had been built
of them
in order
to throw over
him
He
however
having passed
through
[the] midst
of them
went away
And
He went down
to
Capernaum
a city
-
of Galilee
And
He was
teaching
them
on
the
Sabbaths
and
they were astonished
at
the
teaching
of Him
for
with
authority
was
the
message
of Him
And
in
the
synagogue
was
a man
having
a spirit
of a demon
unclean
and
he cried out
in a voice
loud
Ha
What
to us
and
to You
Jesus
of Nazareth
Are You come
to destroy
us
I know
You
who
are
the
Holy [One]
-
of God
And
rebuked
him
-
Jesus
saying
Be silent
and
come forth
out of
him
And
having thrown
him
the
demon
into
the
midst
it came out
from
him
in nothing
having hurt
him
And
came
astonishment
upon
all
and
they were speaking
to
one another
saying
What
-
word
[is] this
that
with
authority
and
power
He commands
the
unclean
spirits
and
they come out
And
was spreading
the report
concerning
Him
into
every
place
of the
surrounding region
Having risen up
then
out of
the
synagogue
He entered
into
the
house
of Simon
[The] mother-in-law
then
-
of Simon
was
oppressed with
a fever
great
and
they appealed
to Him
for
her
And
having stood
over
her
He rebuked
the
fever
and
it left
her
immediately
then
having arisen
she began to serve
them
At the setting
now
of the
sun
all
as many as
had [any]
ailing
with diseases
various
brought
them
to
Him
-
and
on one
each
of them
the
hands
having laid
He would heal
them
Were going out
now
also
demons
from
many
crying out
and
saying
-
You
are
the
Son
-
of God
And
rebuking [them]
not
did He allow
them
to speak
because
they knew
the
Christ
Him
to be
Having arrived
now
daybreak
having gone out
He went
into
a solitary
place
and
the
crowds
were seeking
Him
and
they came
up to
Him
and
were detaining
Him
of the
not
to go
from
them
-
But
He said
to
them
-
Also
to the
other
towns
to preach [the] good news
Me
it behooves
of the
kingdom
-
of God
because
for
this
have I been sent forth
And
He was
preaching
in
the
synagogues
-
of Judea
It came to pass
then
in
-
the
crowd
pressing on
Him
also
to hear
the
word
of
God
and
He
was
standing
by
the
lake
of Gennesaret
and
He saw
boats
two
lying
by
the
lake
-
but
the fishermen
from
them
having gone out
were washing
the
nets
Having entered
then
into
one
of the
boats
which
was
Simonâs
He asked
him
from
the
land
to put off
a little
Having sat down
then
from
the
boat
He was teaching
the
crowds
When
then
He left off
speaking
He said
to
-
Simon
Put off
into
the
deep
and
let down
the
nets
of you
for
a catch
And
answering
Simon
said
Master
through
whole
night
having toiled
nothing
have we taken
at
however
the
word
of You
I will let down
the
nets
And
this
having done
they enclosed
a multitude
of fishes
great
were breaking
now
the
nets
of them
And
they beckoned
to the
partners
in
the
other
boat
-
having come
to help
them
and
they came
and
filled
both
the
boats
so that
were sinking
they
Having seen
now
Simon
Peter
fell at
the
knees
of Jesus
saying
Depart
from
me
for
a man
sinful
am I
Lord
Amazement
for
laid hold
on him
and
on all
those
with
him
at
the
catch
of the
fish
which
they had taken
likewise
now
also
James
and
John
[the] sons
of Zebedee
who
were
partners
-
with Simon
And
said
to
-
Simon
-
Jesus
Not
fear
from
-
now on
men
you will be
catching
And
having brought
the
boats
to
the
land
having left
all
they followed
Him
And
it came to pass
in
-
being
His
in
one
of the
cities
that
behold
a man
full
of leprosy
having seen
then
-
Jesus
having fallen
upon
[his] face
begged
Him
saying
Lord
if
You would be willing
You are able
me
to cleanse
And
having stretched out
the
hand
He touched
him
saying
I am willing
be you cleansed
And
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
him
And
He
ordered
him
no one
to tell
But
having gone
show
yourself
to the
priest
and
offer
for
the
cleansing
of you
as
commanded
Moses
for
a testimony
to them
Was spread abroad
now
still more
the
report
concerning
Him
and
were coming
crowds
great
to hear
and
to be healed
from
the
sicknesses
of them
He Himself
now
was
withdrawing
into
the
wilderness
and
praying
And
it came to pass
on
one
of the
days
that
He
was
teaching
and
there were
sitting by
Pharisees
and
teachers of the law
who
were
come
out of
every
village
-
of Galilee
and
of Judea
and
of Jerusalem
And
[the] power
of [the] Lord
was [there]
for
-
to heal
Him
And
behold
men
carrying
upon
a mat
a man
who
was
paralyzed
and
they were seeking
him
to bring in
and
to place
before
Him
And
not
having found
what way
they should bring in
him
on account of
the
crowd
having gone up
on
the
housetop
through
the
tiles
they let down
him
with
the
mat
into
the
midst
before
-
Jesus
And
having seen
the
faith
of them
He said
Man
have been forgiven
you
the
sins
of you
And
began
to reason
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
saying
Who
is
this
who
speaks
blasphemies
Who
is able
sins
to forgive
if
not
alone
-
God
Having known
now
-
Jesus
the
reasonings
of them
answering
He said
to
them
Why
reason you
in
the
hearts
of you
Which
is
easier
to say
Have been forgiven
you
the
sins
of you
or
to say
Arise
and
walk
That
however
you may know
that
the
Son
-
of Man
authority
has
on
the
earth
to forgive
sins
He said
to the [one]
having been paralyzed
To you
I say
arise
and
having taken up
the
mat
of you
go
to
the
house
of you
And
immediately
having stood up
before
them
having taken up
[that] on
which
he was lying
he departed
to
the
home
of him
glorifying
-
God
And
amazement
seized
all
and
they were glorifying
-
God
and
were filled
with fear
saying
-
We have seen
remarkable things
today
And
after
these things
He went forth
and
He saw
a tax collector
named
Levi
sitting
at
the
tax booth
and
He said
to him
Follow
Me
And
having left
all
having arisen
he began to follow
Him
And
made
a banquet
great
Levi
for Him
in
the
house
of him
and
there was
a multitude
great
of tax collectors
and
others
who
were
with
them
reclining
And
were grumbling
the
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
of them
at
the
disciples
of Him
saying
Because of
why
with
the
tax collectors
and
sinners
do you eat
and
drink
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to
them
No
need
have
those
being well
of a physician
but
those
sick
being
Not
I have come
to call
righteous [ones]
but
sinners
to
repentance
-
And
they said
to
Him
The
disciples
of John
fast
often
and
prayers
make
likewise
also
those
of the
Pharisees
those
however
of You
eat
and
drink
-
And
Jesus
said
to
them
Not
are you able
the
sons
of the
bridechamber
in
which [time]
the
bridegroom
with
them
is
to make
to fast
Will come
however
days
also
when
shall be taken away
from
them
the
bridegroom
then
they will fast
in
those
-
days
He was speaking
now
also
a parable
to
them
-
No one
a piece
of
a garment
new
having torn
puts [it]
on
a garment
old
if
however
otherwise
also
the
new
he will tear
and
the
old
not
will match
which [is]
[the] piece
-
of
the
new
And
no one
puts
wine
new
into
wineskins
old
if
now
otherwise
will burst
the
wine
-
new
the
wineskins
and
it
will be spilled out
and
the
wineskins
will be destroyed
But
wine
new
into
wineskins
fresh
must be put
And
no one
having drunk
old [wine]
desires
new
he says
for
The
old
better
is
It came to pass
then
on
a Sabbath
is passing along
He
through
grainfields
and
were plucking
the
disciples
of Him
and
were eating
the
heads of grain
rubbing [them]
in the
hands
Some
however
of the
Pharisees
said
Why
do you
that which
not
it is lawful
[on] the
Sabbaths
And
answering
to
them
said
-
Jesus
Not even
this
have you read
that which
did
David
when
was hungry
he himself
and
those who
with
him
were
how
he entered
into
the
house
-
of God
and
the
loaves
of the
presentation
having taken
ate
and
gave
to those
with
him
which
not
it is lawful
to eat
if
not
only
to the
priests
And
He was saying
to them
Lord
is
of the
Sabbath
the
Son
-
of Man
It came to pass
then
on
another
Sabbath
entered
He
into
the
synagogue
and
taught
and
there was
a man
there
and
the
hand
of him
the
right
was
withered
Were closely watching
now
Him
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
whether
on
the
Sabbath
He will heal
that
they might find [reason]
to accuse
Him
He
now
knew
the
thoughts
of them
He said
now
to the
man
the
withered
having
the
hand
Arise
and
stand
in
the
midst
And
having risen up
he stood
Said
then
-
Jesus
to
them
I ask
you
whether
it is lawful
on the
Sabbath
to do good
or
to do evil
Life
to save
or
to destroy
And
having looked around
all
on them
He said
to him
Stretch out
the
hand
of you
-
And
he did
and
was restored
the
hand
of him
They themselves
then
were filled
with rage
and
were discussing
with
one another
what
-
they might do
-
to Jesus
It came to pass
then
in
the
days
those
went out
He
to
the
mountain
to pray
and
He was
spending the night
in
-
prayer
-
to God
And
when
it became
day
He called to [Him]
the
disciples
of Him
also
having chosen out
from
them
twelve
whom
also
apostles
He named
Simon
whom
also
He named
Peter
and
Andrew
the
brother
of him
and
James
and
John
and
Philip
and
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
and
Thomas
and
James
[son of] Alphaeus
and
Simon
the [one]
called
Zealot
and
Judas [son]
of James
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
became
[the] betrayer
And
having descended
with
them
He stood
on
a place
level
and
a crowd
large
of disciples
of Him
and
a multitude
great
of the
people
from
all
-
Judea
and
Jerusalem
and
the
sea coast
of Tyre
and
Sidon
who
came
to hear
Him
and
to be healed
of
the
diseases
of them
And
those
troubled
with
spirits
unclean
were healed
And
all
the
multitude
were seeking
to touch
Him
because
power
from
Him
was going out
and
healing
all
And
He
having lifted up
the
gaze
of Him
upon
the
disciples
of Him
was saying
Blessed [are]
the
poor
for
yours
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
Blessed [are]
those
hungering
now
for
you will be filled
Blessed [are]
those
weeping
now
for
you will laugh
Blessed
are you
when
shall hate
you
-
men
and
when
they shall exclude
you
and
shall insult [you]
and
shall cast out
the
name
of you
as
evil
on account of
the
Son
-
of Man
Rejoice
in
that
-
day
and
leap for joy
behold
for
the
reward
of you
[is] great
in
-
heaven
According to
these things
of them
for
used to treat
the
prophets
the
fathers
likewise
But
woe
to you
who are
rich
for
you are receiving
the
comfort
of you
Woe
to you
who
having been filled
now
for
you will hunger
Woe to
those
laughing
now
for
you will mourn
and
will weep
Woe to you
when
well
of you
speak
all
-
men
according to
these things
of them
for
used to treat
the
false prophets
the
fathers
likewise
But
to you
I say
to those
hearing
Love
the
enemies
of you
good
do
to those
hating
you
bless
those
cursing
you
pray
for
those
mistreating
you
To the [one]
striking
you
on
the
cheek
offer
also
the
other
and
from
the [one]
taking away
your
-
cloak
also
the
tunic
not
do withhold
To everyone
asking
you
give
and
from
the [one]
taking away
what [is]
yours
not
ask [it] back
And
as
you desire
that
should do
to you
-
men
do
to them
likewise
And
if
you love
those
loving
you
what
to you
credit
is it
Even
for
-
sinners
those
loving
them
love
And
for
if
you do good
to those
doing good to
you
what
to you
credit
is it
For even
-
sinners
the
same
do
And
if
you lend [to those]
from
whom
you expect
to receive back
what
to you
credit
is it
Even
sinners
to sinners
lend
that
they might receive
the
same amount
But
love
the
enemies
of you
and
do good
and
lend
nothing
expecting in return
and
will be
the
reward
of you
great
and
you will be
sons of
the Most High
for
He
kind
is
to
the
ungrateful
and
evil
Be you
merciful
as
the
Father
of you
merciful
is
And
not
judge
that
no
not
you should be judged
and
not
condemn
that
no
not
you should be condemned
Forgive
and
you will be forgiven
Give
and
it will be given
to you
Measure
good
pressed down
shaken together
running over
will they put
into
the
lap
of you
with that
for
measure
you measure
it will be measured again
to you
He spoke
then
also
a parable
to them
Not
is able
a blind [man]
a blind [man]
to lead
Not
both
into
a pit
will fall
Not
is
a disciple
above
the
teacher
fully trained
however
everyone
will be
like
the
teacher
of him
Why
now
look you at
the
splinter
that [is]
in
the
eye
of the
brother
of you
-
and
the beam
that [is]
in
the
own
eye
not
notice
How
are you able
to say
to
brother
of you
Brother
let [that]
I might cast out
the
splinter
that [is]
in
the
eye
of you
yourself
the
in
the
eye
of you
beam
not
seeing
Hypocrite
cast out
first
the
beam
from
the
eye
of you
and
then
you will see clearly
the
splinter
-
in
the
eye
of the
brother
of you
to cast out
No
for
there is
tree
good
producing
fruit
bad
nor
again
a tree
bad
producing
fruit
good
Each
for
tree
by
the
own
fruit
is known
Not
for
from
thorns
do they gather
figs
nor
from
a bramble bush
grapes
gather they
The
good
man
out of
the
good
treasure
of the
heart
brings forth
that which [is]
good
and
the
evil
out of
the
evil
brings forth
that which [is]
evil
Out of
for
the abundance
of his heart
speaks
the
mouth
of him
Why
now
Me
do you call
Lord
Lord
and
not
do
what
I say
Everyone
who
is coming
to
Me
and
hearing
of Me
the
words
and
doing
them
I will show
you
whom
he is
like
Like
he is
to a man
building
a house
who
dug
and
deepened
and
laid
a foundation
on
the
rock
a flood
then
having come
burst upon
the
stream
the
house
that
and
not
was able
to shake
it
because
-
well
had been built
it
The [one]
however
having heard
and
not
having done
like
is
to a man
having built
a house
on
the
ground
without
a foundation
on which
burst
the
stream
and
immediately
it fell
and
was
the
ruin
of the
house
that
great
And when
He had completed
all
the
words
of Him
in
the
hearing
of the
people
He entered
into
Capernaum
Of a centurion
then
a certain
servant
sick
being
was about
to die
who
was
to him
valued highly
Having heard
then
about
-
Jesus
he sent
to
Him
elders
of the
Jews
begging
Him
that
having come
He might save
the
servant
of him
-
And
having come
to
-
Jesus
they were begging
Him
earnestly
saying
that
Worthy
he is
to whom
You will grant
this
he loves
for
the
nation
of us
and
the
synagogue
he
built
for us
-
And
Jesus
was going
with
them
Already
then
He
not
far
being distant
from
the
house
sent
friends
the
centurion
saying
to Him
Lord
not
trouble Yourself
not
for
worthy
I am
that
under
the
roof
of me
You should come
therefore
neither
myself
counted I worthy
to
You
to come
but
say
in a word
and
shall be healed
the
servant
of me
Also
for
I
a man
am
under
authority
appointed
having
under
me
soldiers
and
I say
to this [one]
Go
and
he goes
and
to another
Come
and
he comes
and
to
[the] servant
of me
Do
this
and
he does [it]
Having heard
then
these things
-
Jesus
marveled at
him
and
having turned
to the
following
Him
crowd
He said
I say
to you
not even
in
-
Israel
such great
faith
did I find
And
having returned
to
the
house
those
having been sent
found
the
servant
in good health
And
it came to pass
on
the
next [day]
He went
into
a town
called
Nain
and
were going with
Him
the
disciples
of Him
and
a crowd
great
As
then
He drew near
to the
gate
of the
town
also
behold
was being carried out
[one] having died
only begotten
son
of the
mother
of him
and
she
was
a widow
And
a crowd
of the
town
considerable
was
with
her
And
having seen
her
the
Lord
was moved with compassion
on
her
and
said
to her
Not
weep
And
having come up
He touched
the
bier
those
then
bearing [it]
stopped
And
He said
Young man
to you
I say
Arise
And
sat up
the
dead [man]
and
began
to speak
and
He gave
him
to the
mother
of him
Seized
then
fear
all
and
they began glorifying
-
God
saying
-
A prophet
great
has risen up
among
us
and
-
Has visited
-
God
the
people
of Him
And
went out
the
report
this
in
all
-
Judea
concerning
Him
and
in all
the
surrounding region
And
brought word
to John
the
disciples
of him
concerning
all
these things
And
having called near
two
certain
-
disciples
of him
-
John
sent [them]
to
the
Lord
saying
You
are
the
coming [One]
or
another
are we to look for
Having come
then
to
Him
the
men
said
John
the
Baptist
has sent
us
to
you
saying
You
are
the
coming [One]
or
another
are we to look for
At
that very
-
hour
He healed
many
of
diseases
and
afflictions
and
spirits
evil
and
to blind
many
He granted
to see
And
answering
He said
to them
Having gone
relate
to John
what
you have seen
and
heard
Blind
receive sight
lame
walk
lepers
are cleansed
and
deaf
hear
dead
are raised
poor
are gospelized
And
blessed
is
who
if
not
shall be offended
in
Me
Having departed
then
the
messengers
of John
He began
to speak
to
the
crowds
concerning
John
What
have you gone out
into
the
wilderness
to see
A reed
by
[the] wind
shaken
But
what
have you gone out
to see
A man
in
fine
clothing
arrayed
Behold
those
in
clothing
splendid
and
in luxury
living
in
the
palaces
are
But
what
have you gone out
to see
A prophet
Yes
I say
to you
and [one]
more excellent
than a prophet
This
is he
concerning
whom
it has been written
Behold
I send
the
messenger
of Me
before
[the] face
of you
who
will prepare
the
way
of You
before
You
I say
to you
a greater
among
[those] born
of women
than John
no one
is
-
yet
the least
in
the
kingdom
of
God
greater
than he
is
And
all
the
people
having heard
even
the
tax collectors
declared as righteous
-
God
having been baptized [with]
the
baptism
of John
-
but
the Pharisees
and
the
lawyers
the
counsel
-
of God
rejected
as to
themselves
not
having been baptized
by
him
To what
therefore
will I liken
the
men
of the
generation
this
And
to what
are they
like
Like
are they
to little children
-
in
the marketplace
sitting
and
calling
to each other
one
saying
We piped
to you
and
not
you did dance
we sang a dirge
and
not
you did weep
Has come
for
John
the
Baptist
neither
eating
bread
nor
drinking
wine
and
you say
A demon
He has
Has come
the
Son
-
of Man
eating
and
drinking
and
you say
Behold
a man
a glutton
and
a drunkard
a friend
of tax collectors
and
of sinners
And
was justified
-
wisdom
by
all
the
children
of her
Was asking
now
one
Him
of the
Pharisees
that
He should eat
with
him
and
having entered
into
the
house
of the
Pharisee
He reclined
And
behold
a woman
who
was
in
the
city
a sinner
And
she having known
that
He had reclined
in
the
house
of the
Pharisee
having taken
an alabaster flask
of fragrant oil
and
having stood
behind Him
at
the
feet
of Him
weeping
the
tears
she began
to wet
with the
feet
of Him
and
with the
hairs
of the
head
of her
she was wiping [them]
and
was kissing
the
feet
of Him
and
was anointing [them]
with the
fragrant oil
Having seen
now
the
Pharisee
the [one]
having invited
Him
he spoke
within
himself
saying
This
if
He were
a prophet
would have known
-
who
and
what
the
woman [is]
who
touches
Him
for
a sinner
she is
And
answering
-
Jesus
said
to
him
Simon
I have
to you
something
to say
-
And
Teacher
say [it]
he says
Two
debtors
there were
to a creditor
certain
the
one
owed
denarii
five hundred
-
and
the other
fifty
Nothing
having
they
to pay
both
he forgave
Which
therefore
of them
more
will love
him
Answering
Simon
said
I take it
that
[he] to whom
the
most
he forgave
-
And
He said
to him
Rightly
You have judged
And
having turned
to
the
woman
-
to Simon
He was saying
See you
this
the
woman
I entered
of you
into
the
house
water
of Me
for
feet
not
you gave
with her
however
-
tears
she wet
My
-
feet
and
with
[the] hair
of her
wiped [them]
A kiss
to Me
not
you gave
she herself
however
from
which [time]
I came in
not
has ceased
kissing
My
-
feet
With oil
the
head
of Me
not
you did anoint
she herself
however
with fragrant oil
anointed
the
feet
of Me
This
therefore
I say
to you
have been forgiven
the
sins
of her
-
many
for
she loved
much
to whom
however
little
is forgiven
little
he loves
He said
then
to her
Have been forgiven
your
-
sins
And
began
those
reclining
to say
within
themselves
Who
this
is
who
even
sins
forgives
He said
then
to
the
woman
The
faith
of You
has saved
you
go
in
peace
And
it came to pass
afterward
-
soon
that
He
was traveling
throughout
city
and
village
preaching
and
proclaiming the good news
of the
kingdom
-
of God
And
the
Twelve
[were] with
Him
and
women
certain
who
had been
cured
from
spirits
evil
and
infirmities
Mary
who
is called
Magdalene
from
whom
demons
seven
had gone out
and
Joanna
wife
of Chuza
a steward
of Herod
and
Susanna
and
others
many
who
were ministering
to them
out of
the
means
their own
[As] is assembling
now
a crowd
great
and
those
from each
town
are coming
to
Him
He spoke
by
a parable
Went out
the [one]
sowing
-
to sow
the
seed
of him
And
in
the
sowing
of him
some
indeed
fell
along
the
road
and
it was trampled upon
and
the
birds
of the
air
devoured
it
And
other
fell
upon
the
rock
and
having sprung up
it withered
through
-
no
having
moisture
And
other
fell
in
[the] midst
of the
thorns
and
having sprung up with [it]
the
thorns
choked
it
And
other
fell
upon
the
soil
-
good
and
having sprung up
it produced
fruit
a hundredfold
These things
saying
He was calling out
The [one]
having
ears
to hear
let him hear
Were asking
then
Him
the
disciples
of Him
What
this
means
the
parable
-
And
He said
To you
it has been given
to know
the
mysteries
of the
kingdom
-
of God
to
however
[the] rest
[it is] in
parables
so that
Seeing
not
may they see
and
hearing
not
may they understand
Is
now
this
the
parable
The
seed
is
the
word
-
of God
Those
now
along
the
road
are
those
having heard
then
comes
the
devil
and
takes away
the
word
from
the
heart
of them
that
not
having believed
they should be saved
Those
now
upon
the
rock
those who
when
they hear
with
joy
receive
the
word
and
these
a root
not
have
who
for
a time
believe
and
in
time
of testing
fall away
That
now
into
the
thorns
having fallen
these
are
those
having heard
and
under
cares
and
riches
and
pleasures
-
of life
moving along
are choked
and
not
do mature
That
now
in
the
good
soil
these
are
those
in
a heart
worthy
and
good
having heard
the
word
keep [it]
and
bring forth fruit
by
perseverance
No one
now
a lamp
having lighted
covers
it
with a vessel
or
under
a bed
puts [it]
but
on
a lampstand
puts [it]
so that
those
entering in
may see
the
light
Nothing
for
is
hidden
which
not
manifest
will become
nor
secret
which
nothing
not
shall be known
and
to
light
come
Take heed
therefore
how
you hear
whoever
-
for
might have
will be given
to him
and
whoever
-
not
might have
even
what
he seems
to have
will be taken away
from
him
Came
then
to
Him
the
mother
and
the
brothers
of Him
and
not
they were able
to get
to Him
because of
the
crowd
It was told
also
Him
The
mother
of You
and
the
brothers
of You
are standing
outside
to see
wanting
You
-
But
answering
He said
to
them
Mother
of Me
and
brothers
of me
those
are
who
the
word
-
of God
are hearing
and
doing
It came to pass
then
on
one
of the
days
also
He
entered
into
a boat
with
the
disciples
of Him
and
He said
to
them
Let us pass over
to
the
other side
of the
lake
And
they launched out
Sailing
then
of them
He fell asleep
And
came down
a storm
of wind
on
the
lake
and
they were being swamped
and
were in danger
Having come to [Him]
then
they awoke
Him
saying
Master
Master
we are perishing
-
And
having arisen
He rebuked
the
wind
and
the
raging
of the
water
and
they ceased
and
there was
a calm
He said
then
to them
Where is
the
faith
of you
Having been afraid
then
they marveled
saying
to
one another
Who
then
this
is
that
even
the
winds
He commands
and
the
water
and
they obey
Him
And
they sailed down
to
the
region
of the
Gerasenes
which
is
opposite
-
Galilee
Having gone forth
then
He
upon
the
land
met [Him]
a man
certain
out of
the
city
having
demons
and
time
a long
not
was wearing
clothing
and
in
a house
not
did abide
but
in
the
tombs
Having seen
then
-
Jesus
having cried out
he fell down before
Him
and
in a voice
loud
said
What
to me
and
to You
Jesus
Son
-
of God
the
Most High
I implore
of You
not
me
You might torment
He was commanding
for
the
spirit
-
unclean
to come out
from
the
man
Many
for
times
it had seized
him
and
he was bound
with chains
and
shackles
being kept
and
breaking
the
chains
he was driven
by
the
demon
into
the
deserts
Asked
now
him
-
Jesus
What
your
name
is
-
And
he said
Legion
because
were entered
demons
many
into
him
And
they were begging
Him
that
not
he would command
them
into
the
abyss
to go away
There was
now
there
a herd
of pigs
many
feeding
in
the
mountain
and
they begged
Him
that
He would allow
them
into
them
to enter
and
He allowed
them
Having gone out
then
the
demons
from
the
man
they entered
into
the
pigs
and
rushed
the
herd
down
the
steep bank
into
the
lake
and
was drowned
Having seen
then
those
feeding [them]
that
having taken place
they fled
and
reported [it]
to
the
city
and
to
the
country
They went out
then
to see
that
having taken place
and
they came
to
-
Jesus
and
found
sitting
the
man
from
whom
the
demons
had gone out
clothed
and
being of sound mind
at
the
feet
-
of Jesus
And
they were afraid
Related
then
to them
those
having seen [it]
how
was healed
the [one]
having been possessed by demons
And
asked
Him
all
the
multitude
of the
surrounding region
of the
Gerasenes
to depart
from
them
because
with fear
great
they were seized
He
now
having entered
into
the boat
turned back
Was begging
however
Him
the
man
from
whom
had gone
the
demons
to be [taken]
with
Him
He sent away
however
him
saying
Return
to
the
house
of you
and
relate
all that
for you
has done
-
God
And
he departed
through
all
the
city
proclaiming
all that
had done
for him
-
Jesus
When
then
-
returned
-
Jesus
received
Him
the
crowd
they were
for
all
looking for
Him
And
behold
came
a man
whose
name [was]
Jairus
and
he
a ruler
of the
synagogue
was
and
having fallen
at
the
feet
of Jesus
he began begging
Him
to come
to
the
house
of him
because
daughter
an only
was
to him
about
years [old]
twelve
and
she
was dying
As
then
-
went
He
the
crowds
were pressing around
Him
And
a woman
being
with
a flux
of blood
for
years
twelve
who
neither
was able
by
no one
to be healed
having come
behind
touched
the
fringe
the
of cloak
of Him
and
immediately
stopped
the
flux
of the
blood
of her
And
said
-
Jesus
Who [is]
the [one]
having touched
Me
Were denying [it]
however
all
said
-
Peter
Master
the
people
surround
You
and
press in
-
But
Jesus
said
Touched
Me
someone
I
for
know
power
has gone out
from
Me
Having seen
then
the
woman
that
not
she was hid
trembling
she came
and
having fallen down before
Him
for
what
cause
she touched
Him
she declared
before
all
the
people
and
how
she was healed
immediately
-
And
He said
to her
Daughter
the
faith
of you
has healed
you
go
in
peace
Still
of Him
speaking
comes
one
from
the
synagogue ruler
saying
-
Has died
the
daughter
of You
no longer
trouble
the
Teacher
-
But
Jesus
having heard
answered
him
Not
fear
only
believe
and
she will be saved
Having entered
then
into
the
house
not
He did allow
to go in
anyone
with
Him
if
not
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
the
father
of the
child
and
the
mother
They were weeping
now
all
and
mourning for
her
-
But
He said
Not
weep
not
she is dead
but
sleeps
And
they were laughing at
Him
knowing
that
she was dead
He
now
having taken hold
of the
hand
of her
called out
saying
-
Child
arise
And
returned
the
spirit
of her
and
she arose
immediately
and
He directed
to her
to be given
to eat
And
were amazed
the
parents
of her
-
and
He instructed
them
no one
to tell
what
had happened
Having called together
then
the
Twelve
He gave
to them
power
and
authority
over
all
the
demons
and
diseases
to heal
and
He sent
them
to proclaim
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
to heal
and
He said
to
them
Nothing
take
for
the
journey
neither
staff
nor
bag
nor
bread
nor
money
nor
apiece
two
tunics
to have
And
into
whatever
-
house
you might enter
there
remain
and
from there
go forth
And
as many as
-
not
might receive
you
going forth
from
the
city
that
the
dust
from
the
feet
of you
shake off
as
a testimony
against
them
Going forth
then
they were passing
through
the
villages
proclaiming the gospel
and
healing
everywhere
Heard of
now
Herod
the
Tetrarch
the things
being done
all
and
was perplexed
because
-
it was said
by
some
-
John
has been raised
out from
[the] dead
by
some
also
that
Elijah
had appeared
by others
also
that
a prophet
one
of the
ancients
had arisen
Said
then
Herod
John
I
beheaded
who
however
is
this
concerning
whom
I hear
such things
And
he was seeking
to see
Him
And
having returned
the
apostles
related
to Him
whatever
they had done
And
having taken
them
He withdrew
by
Himself
into
a town
called
Bethsaida
The
now
crowds
having known [it]
followed
Him
and
having received
them
He was speaking
to them
concerning
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
those
need
having
of healing
He was healing
-
And
the day
began
to decline
having come
then
the
Twelve
said
to Him
Dismiss
the
crowd
that
having gone
into
the
surrounding
villages
and
countryside
they might lodge
and
might find
provisions
for
here
in
a desolate
place
we are
He said
now
to
them
Give
to them
to eat
you
-
But
they said
Not
there are
to us
more
than
loaves
five
and
fish
two
if
not
having gone
we
should buy
for
all
the
people
this
food
They were
for
about
men
five thousand
He said
then
to
the
disciples
of Him
Make sit down
them
groups
of about
in
fifty
And
they did
so
and
made sit down
all
Having taken
then
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish
having looked up
to
the
heaven
He blessed
them
and
broke [them]
and
He kept giving [them]
to the
disciples
to set before
the
crowd
And
they ate
and
were satisfied
all
and
was taken up
that
having been a surplus
to them
of fragments
hand-baskets
twelve
And
it came to pass
as
-
was
He
praying
in
solitary
were with
Him
the
disciples
and
He questioned
them
saying
Whom
Me
the
crowds
do pronounce
to be
-
And
answering
they said
John
the
Baptist
others
also
Elijah
others
now
that
a prophet
one
of the
ancients
has arisen
He said
then
to them
You
however
whom
Me
do pronounce
to be
Peter
then
answering
said
The
Christ
-
of God
-
And
having strictly warned
them
He instructed [them]
to no one
to tell
this
having said
-
It is necessary for
the
Son
-
of Man
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
the
elders
and
chief priests
and
scribes
and
to be killed
and
on the
third
day
to be raised
He was saying
then
to
all
If
anyone
desires
after
Me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
let him take up
the
cross
of him
every
day
and
let him follow
Me
Whoever
for
-
might desire
the
life
of him
to save
will lose
it
whoever
however
-
might lose
the
life
of him
on account of
me
he
will save
it
What
for
is profited
a man
having gained
the
world
whole
himself
now
having destroyed
or
having suffered the loss of
Whoever
for
-
may have been ashamed of
Me
and
-
My
words
him
the
Son
-
of Man
will be ashamed of
when
He shall come
in
the
glory
of Himself
and
of the
Father
and
of the
holy
angels
I say
now
to you
truthfully
there are
some
of those
here
standing
who
no
not
shall taste
of death
until
-
they shall have seen
the
kingdom
-
of God
It came to pass
now
after
the
sayings
these
about
days
eight
and
having taken
Peter
and
John
and
James
He went up
on
the
mountain
to pray
And
it came to pass
in
the
praying
of Him
the
appearance
of the
face
of Him
[was] altered
and
the
clothing
of Him
white
became dazzling
And
behold
men
two
began talking with
Him
who
were
Moses
and
Elijah
Those
having appeared
in
glory
were speaking of
the
going out
of Him
which
He was about
to accomplish
in
Jerusalem
-
And
Peter
and
those
with
him
were
heavy
with sleep
having awoken fully
then
they saw
the
glory
of Him
and
the
two
men
-
standing with
Him
And
it came to pass
in
the
departing
of them
from
Him
said
-
Peter
to
-
Jesus
Master
good
it is
for us
here
to be
also
let us make
tabernacles
three
one
for You
and
one
for Moses
and
one
for Elijah
not
knowing
what
he is saying
These things
then
as he
is saying
came
a cloud
and
was overshadowing
them
they feared
then
in
the
entering
of them
into
the
cloud
And
a voice
came
out of
the
cloud
saying
This
is
the
Son
of Me
-
whom I have chosen
Him
listen to
And
as
-
occurred
the
voice
was found
Jesus
alone
And
they
were silent
and
to no one
they told
in
those
the
days
anything
of what
they had seen
It came to pass
then
the
next
day
on having come down
of them
from
the
mountain
met
Him
a crowd
great
And
behold
a man
from
the
crowd
cried out
saying
Teacher
I implore
You
to look
upon
the
son
of me
for
an only child
to me
he is
And
behold
a spirit
takes
him
and
suddenly
he cries out
and
it throws into convulsions
him
with
foaming
and
with difficulty
it departs
from
him
bruising
him
And
I begged
the
disciples
of You
that
they might cast out
it
and
not
they were able
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
O
generation
unbelieving
and
perverted
until
when
will I be
with
you
and
bear with
you
Bring
here
the
son
of you
While
then
he was coming near
of him
threw down
him
the
demon
and
threw [him] into convulsions
Rebuked
then
-
Jesus
the
spirit
-
unclean
and
healed
the
boy
and
gave back
him
to
father
of him
Were astonished
then
all
at
the
majesty
-
of God
Of all
however
wondering
at
all
which
He did
He said
to
the
disciples
of Him
Let sink
you
into
the
ears
of you
the
words
these
-
for
the Son
-
of Man
is about
to be betrayed
into
[the] hands
of men
-
But
they understand not
the
saying
this
and
it was
veiled
from
them
that
not
they should understand
it
And
they were afraid
to ask
Him
concerning
the
saying
this
Came up
then
an argument
among
them
this
who
-
might be
greatest
of them
-
But
Jesus
having known
the
reasoning
of the
heart
of them
having taken hold of
a child
set
it
by
Him
and
He said
to them
Whoever
if
shall receive
this
-
child
in
the
name
of Me
Me
receives
and
whoever
-
Me
shall receive
receives
the [One]
having sent
Me
The [one]
for
least
among
all
you
being
he
shall be
great
Answering
now
-
John
said
Master
we saw
someone
in
the
name
of You
casting out
demons
and
we were forbidding
him
because
not
he follows
with
us
Said
then
to
him
Jesus
Not
forbid
whoever
for
not
is
against
you
for
you
is
It came to pass
then
in
the
completing
the
days
of the
ascension
of Him
that
He
the
face
steadfastly set
-
to go
to
Jerusalem
And
He sent
messengers
before
[the] face
of Him
And
having gone
they entered
into
a village
of the Samaritans
so as
to make ready
for Him
And
not
they did receive
Him
because
the
face
of Him
was [as]
going
toward
Jerusalem
Having seen [it]
now
the
disciples
James
and
John
said
Lord
will You [that]
we should call
fire
to come down
from
-
heaven
and
to consume
them
Having turned
then
He rebuked
them
And
they went
to
another
village
And
going
of them
along
the
road
said
someone
to
Him
I will follow
You
wherever
if
You may go
And
said
to him
-
Jesus
The
foxes
holes
have
and
the
birds
of the
air
nests
-
but
the Son
-
of Man
not
has
where
the
head
He might lay
He said
then
to
another
Follow
Me
-
But
he said
allow
me
first
having gone away
to bury
the
father
of me
He said
then
to him
Leave
the
dead
to bury
-
their own
dead
you
however
having gone forth
declare
the
kingdom
-
of God
Said
then
also
another
I will follow
You
Lord
first
however
allow
me
to bid farewell
to those
at
the
home
of me
Said
then
to
him
-
Jesus
No one
having laid
the
hand
upon
[the] plow
and
looking
on
the things
behind
fit
is
for the
kingdom
-
of God
After
now
these things
appointed
the
Lord
others
seventy
and
sent
them
in
two [by]
before
[the] face
of Himself
into
every
city
and
place
where
was about
He Himself
to go
He was saying
then
to
them
The
indeed
harvest [is]
plentiful
-
but
the workmen
[are] few
Pray earnestly to
therefore
the
Lord
of the
harvest
that
workmen
He may send out
into
the
harvest
of Him
Go
behold
I send forth
you
as
lambs
in
[the] midst
of wolves
Neither
carry
purse
nor
bag
nor
sandals
and
no one
on
the
road
greet
Into
whatever
now
-
you might enter
house
first
say
Peace
to the
house
this
And
if
there
is
a son
of peace
will rest
upon
him
the
peace
of you
if
however
not so
to
you
it will return
In
the same
now
-
house
remain
eating
and
drinking
the things [supplied]
by
them
worthy [is]
for
the
workman
of the
wages
of him
Not
move
from
house
to
house
And
into
whatever
-
city
you might enter
and
they receive
you
eat
the things
set before
you
And
heal
-
in
it
[the] sick
and
say
to them
Has drawn near
to
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
Into
whatever
now
-
city
you might enter
and
not
they receive
you
having gone out
into
the
streets
of it
say
Even
the
dust
-
having clung
to us
out of
the
city
of you
to
the
feet
we wipe off
against you
yet
this
know
that
has drawn near
the
kingdom
-
of God
I say
to you
that
for Sodom
in
the
day
that
more tolerable
it will be
than
the
city
for that
Woe
to you
Chorazin
Woe
to you
Bethsaida
For
if
in
Tyre
and
Sidon
had taken place
the
miracles
-
having taken place
in
you
long ago
-
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
sitting
they would have repented
But
for Tyre
and
Sidon
more tolerable
will it be
in
the
judgment
than
for you
And
you
Capernaum
not
to
heaven
will you be lifted up
to
-
Hades
you will be brought down
The [one]
hearing
you
Me
hears
and
the [one]
rejecting
you
Me
rejects
the [one]
now
Me
rejecting
rejects
the [One]
having sent
Me
Returned
then
the
seventy
with
joy
saying
Lord
even
the
demons
are subject
to us
through
the
name
of You
He said
then
to them
I beheld
-
Satan
as
lightning
out of
the
heaven
having fallen
Behold
I give
you
the
authority
-
to tread
upon
serpents
and
scorpions
and
upon
all
the
power
of the
enemy
and
nothing
you
no
not
will injure
Yet
in
this
not
rejoice
that
the
spirits
to you
are subjected
rejoice
however
that
the
names
of you
are written
in
the
heavens
In
the same
-
hour
He rejoiced
the
Spirit
-
Holy
and
said
I fully consent
to You
Father
Lord
of the
heaven
and
of the
earth
that
You have hidden
these things
from
wise
and
intelligent
and
have revealed
them
to little children
yes
-
Father
for
thus
well-pleasing
was it
before
You
All things
to Me
have been delivered
by
the
Father
of Me
And
no one
knows
who
is
the
Son
if
not
the
Father
and
who
is
the
Father
if
not
the
Son
and
to whom
if
might resolve
the
Son
to reveal [Him]
And
having turned
to
the
disciples
in
private
He said
Blessed [are]
the
eyes
-
seeing
what
you see
I say
for
to you
that
many
prophets
and
kings
desired
to see
what
you
see
and
not
saw
and
to hear
what
you hear
and
not
heard
And
behold
a lawyer
certain
stood up
testing
Him
saying
Teacher
what
having done
life
eternal
will I inherit
-
And
He said
to
him
In
the
law
what
has been written
How
read you
-
And
answering
he said
You shall love
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
with
all
the
heart
of you
and
with
all
the
soul
of you
and
with
all
the
strength
of you
and
with
all
the
mind
of you
and
The
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
He said
then
to him
Correctly
you have answered
This
do
and
you will live
-
But
desiring
to justify
himself
he said
to
-
Jesus
And
who
is
my
neighbor
Having taken [it] up
-
Jesus
said
A man
certain
was going down
from
Jerusalem
to
Jericho
and
robbers
fell among
who
both
having stripped
him
and
wounds
having inflicted
went away
having left [him]
half dead
By
chance
now
a priest
certain
was going down
on
the
road
that
and
having seen
him
he passed by on the opposite side
Likewise
now
also
a Levite
to
the
spot
having come
and
having seen [him]
passed by on the opposite side
A Samaritan
however
one
journeying
came
to
him
and
having seen
was moved with compassion
and
having approached
he bound up
the
wounds
of him
pouring on
oil
and
wine
having put
then
him
on
the
own
beast
he brought
him
to
an inn
and
took care
of him
And
on
the
next day
having taken out
two
denarii
he gave [them]
to the
innkeeper
and
said
Take care
of him
and
whatever
more
-
you might expend
of me
on
-
returning
I
will repay
you
Which
of these
-
three
a neighbor
seems
to you
to have been
of the [one]
having fallen
among
the
robbers
-
And
he said
The [one]
having shown
-
compassion
toward
him
Said
then
to him
-
Jesus
Go
and
you
do
likewise
In
now
the
proceeding
of them
He
entered
into
a village
certain
a woman
now
certain
named
Martha
received
Him
into
the
home
And
she
had
a sister
called
Mary
who
also
having sat down
at
the
feet
of the
Lord
was listening to
the
word
of Him
-
But
Martha
was distracted
about
much
service
having come up
now
she said
Lord
not
is it concerning
to You
that
the
sister
of me
alone
me
has left
to serve
Speak
therefore
to her
that
me
she might help
Answering
now
said
to her
the
Lord
Martha
Martha
you are anxious
and
troubled
about
many things
one thing
however
is
necessary
and
one thing
Mary
for
the
good
portion
has chosen
which
not
will be taken away from
her
And
it came to pass
in
-
being
His
in
a place
certain
praying
when
He ceased
said
one
of the
disciples
of Him
to
Him
Lord
teach
us
to pray
as
also
John
taught
the
disciples
of him
He said
then
to them
When
you pray
say
Father
hallowed be
the
name
of You
Come
the
kingdom
of You
The
bread
of us
-
daily
give
us
-
each
day
And
forgive
us
the
sins
of us
also
for
ourselves
we forgive
everyone
indebted
to us
and
not
lead
us
into
temptation
And
He said
to
them
Who
among
you
will have
a friend
and
will go
to
him
at midnight
and
say
to him
Friend
lend
me
three
loaves
since
a friend
of my
is come
off
a journey
to
me
and
nothing
I have
what
I will set before
him
And he
from within
answering
will say
Not
me
trouble
cause
already
the
door
has been shut
and
the
children
of me
with
me
in
the
bed
are
not
I am able
having risen up
to give
to you
I say
to you
if
even
not
he will give
to him
having risen up
because of
-
being
friend
of him
because of
yet
the
persistence
of him
having risen
he will give
him
as much as
he needs
And I
to you
say
ask
and
it will be given
to you
seek
and
you will find
knock
and
it will be opened
to you
Everyone
for
-
asking
receives
and
the [one]
seeking
finds
and
to the [one]
knocking
it will be opened
Which
now
of
you
who [is]
a father
will ask for
the
son
a fish
and
instead of
a fish
a serpent
to him
will he give
Or
also
[if] he will ask for
an egg
will he give
to him
a scorpion
If
therefore
you
evil
being
know
gifts
good
to give
to the
children
of you
how much
more
the
Father
who [is]
in
heaven
will give
[the] Spirit
Holy
to those
asking
Him
And
He was
casting out
a demon
and
it
was
mute
it came to pass
then
the
demon
having gone out
spoke
the
mute [man]
And
marveled
the
crowds
Some
then
of
them
said
By
Beelzebul
the
prince
of the
demons
He casts out
the
demons
Others
now
testing
a sign
from
heaven
were seeking
from
Him
He
now
knowing
their
-
thoughts
said
to them
Every
kingdom
against
itself
having been divided
is brought to desolation
and
a house
against
a house
falls
If
now
also
-
Satan
against
himself
is divided
how
will stand
the
kingdom
of him
For
you say
by
Beelzebul
cast out
I
the
demons
If
now
I
by
Beelzebul
cast out
the
demons
the
sons
of you
by
whom
do they cast out
On account of
this
they
of you
judges
will be
If
however
by
[the] finger
of God
I
cast out
the
demons
then
has come
upon
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
When
the
strong [man]
being armed
might guard
-
his
house
in
peace
are
the
possessions
of him
when
however
[one] stronger
than he
having come upon [him]
shall overcome
him
the
complete armor
of him
he takes away
in
which
he had trusted
and
the
plunder
of him
he divides
The [one]
not
being
with
Me
against
Me
is
and
the [one]
not
gathering
with
Me
scatters
When
the
unclean
spirit
is gone out
from
the
man
it passes
through
waterless
places
seeking
rest
and
not
finding [any]
it says
I will return
to
the
house
of me
from where
I came out
And
having come
it finds [it]
swept
and
put in order
Then
it goes
and
takes
other
spirits
more evil
than itself
seven
and
having entered
they dwell
there
and
becomes
the
last
of the
man
that
worse
than the
first
It came to pass
then
in
-
saying
His
these things
having lifted up
one
[her] voice
a woman
from
the
crowd
said
to Him
Blessed [is]
the
womb
-
having borne
You
and
[the] breasts
at which
You nursed
He
then
said
No rather
blessed [are]
those
hearing
the
word
-
of God
and
keeping it
Of the
now
crowds
being pressed around together
He began
to say
The
generation
this
generation
an evil
is
a sign
it seeks after
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
if
not
the
sign
of Jonah
As
for
was
Jonah
to the
Ninevites
a sign
thus
will be
also
the
Son
-
of Man
to the
generation
this
The Queen
of [the] South
will rise up
in
the
judgment
with
the
men
of the
generation
this
and
will condemn
them
For
she came
from
the
ends
of the
earth
to hear
the
wisdom
of Solomon
and
behold
greater
than Solomon
here
[The] men
of Nineveh
will stand up
in
the
judgment
with
the
generation
this
and
will condemn
it
For
they repented
at
the
preaching
of Jonah
and
behold
greater
than Jonah
[is] here
But no one
a lamp
having lit
in
secret
sets it
nor
under
the
basket
but
upon
the
lampstand
that
those
entering in
the
light
may see
The
lamp
of your
body
is
the
eye
of you
When
the
eye
of you
clear
is
also
all
the
body
of you
light
is
when
however
evil
it be
also
the
body
of you
[is] dark
Take heed
therefore
lest
the
light
that [is]
in
you
darkness
be
If
therefore
the
body
of you
[is] full
of light
not
having
part
any
dark
it will be
light
all
as
when
the
lamp
-
shining
might light
you
In
then
the
speaking
asked
Him
a Pharisee
that
He would dine
with
him
having entered
then
He reclined
-
And
the Pharisee
having seen [it]
marveled
that
not
first
He washed
before
the
dinner
Said
then
the
Lord
to
him
Now
you
-
Pharisees
the
outside
of the
cup
and
of the
dish
you cleanse
-
and
the inside
of you
is full
of plundering
and
wickedness
Fools
[Did] not
the [One]
having made
the
outside
also
the
inside
make
But [of]
the things
being within
give
alms
and
behold
all things
clean
to you
are
But
woe
to you
-
Pharisees
for
you pay tithes of
-
mint
and
-
rue
and
every
herb
and
you pass by
the
justice
and
the
love
-
of God
These things
also
it behooved [you]
to do
and those
not
to neglect
Woe
to you
-
Pharisees
for
you love
the
first seat
in
the
synagogues
and
the
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
Woe
to you
for
you are
like
-
graves
-
unmarked
and
the
men
-
walking
above
not
have known [it]
Answering
now
one
of the
lawyers
says
to Him
Teacher
these things
saying
also
us
You insult
-
And
He said
Also
to you
the
lawyers
woe
For
you burden
the
men
[with] burdens
heavy to bear
and
yourselves
with one
of the
fingers
of you
not
do touch
the
burdens
Woe
to you
for
you build
the
tombs
of the
prophets
-
yet
the fathers
of you
killed
them
So
witnesses
you are
and
consent
to the
works
of the
fathers
of you
For
they
indeed
killed
them
you
now
build [their tombs]
Because of
this
also
the
Wisdom
-
of God
said
I will send
to
them
prophets
and
apostles
and
[some] of
them
they will kill
and
persecute
so that
might be charged
the
blood
of all
the
prophets
-
having been poured out
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world
against
the
generation
this
from
the blood
of Abel
to
the blood
of Zechariah
the [one]
having perished
between
the
altar
and
the
house
Yes
I say
to you
it will be required
of
the
generation
this
Woe
to you
the
lawyers
for
you have taken away
the
key
of the
knowledge
You yourselves
not
did enter
and
those who
are entering
you hindered
From there
having gone forth
of Him
began
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
urgently
to press upon [Him]
and
to make speak
Him
about
many things
watching
Him
to catch
in something
out of
the
mouth
of Him
In
these [times]
having been gathered together
the
myriads
of the
crowd
so as
to trample upon
one another
He began
to say
to
the
disciples
of Him
first
Take heed
to yourselves
of
the
leaven
which
is
hypocrisy
of the
Pharisees
Nothing
now
concealed up
is
which
not
will be revealed
nor
hidden
which
not
will be known
Instead
that
whatever
in
the
darkness
you have said
in
the
light
will be heard
and
what
into
the
ear
you have spoken
in
the
inner rooms
will be proclaimed
upon
the
housetops
I say
now
to you
those
friends
of Me
not
you should fear
because
of those
killing
the
body
and
after
these things
not
being able
more abundantly
anything
to do
I will show
however
you
whom
you should fear
Fear
the [One who]
after
the
killing
has
authority
to cast
into
-
hell
Yes
I say
to you
Him
fear
Not
five
sparrows
are sold for
assarion
two
And
one
of
them
not
is
forgotten
before
-
God
But
even
the
hairs
of the
head
of you
all
have been numbered
Not
fear
than many
sparrows
you are more valuable
I say
now
to you
everyone
who
-
will confess
in
Me
before
the
men
also
the
Son
-
of Man
will confess
in
him
before
the
angels
-
of God
the [one]
now
having denied
Me
before
-
men
will be denied
before
the
angels
-
of God
And
everyone
who
will speak
a word
against
the
Son
-
of Man
it will be forgiven
him
the [one]
however
against
the
Holy
Spirit
having blasphemed
not
will be forgiven
When
then
they bring
you
before
the
synagogues
and
the
rulers
and
the
authorities
not
be anxious
how
or
what
you shall reply in defense
or
what
you should say
the
for
Holy
Spirit
will teach
you
in
same
the
hour
what
it behooves [you]
to say
Said
then
one
from
the
crowd
to Him
Teacher
say
to the
brother
of me
to divide
with
me
the
inheritance
-
And
He said
to him
Man
who
Me
appointed
a judge
or
partitioner
over
you
He said
then
to
them
Beware
and
keep yourselves
from
all
covetousness
for
not
in
the
abundance
to anyone
the
life
to him
is
of
that which
possesses
of him
He spoke
then
a parable
to
them
saying
Of a man
certain
rich
brought forth abundantly
the
ground
And
he was reasoning
within
himself
saying
What
shall I do
for
not
I have
where
I will store up
the
fruits
of me
And
he said
This
will I do
I will tear down
my
-
barns
and
greater
will build
and
will store up
there
all
the
grain
and
the
goods
of me
And
I will say
to the
soul
of me
Soul
you have
many
good things
laid up
for
years
many
take your rest
eat
drink
be merry
Said
then
to him
-
God
Fool
This
-
night
the
soul
of you
is required
of
you
what
now
you did prepare
to whom
will [it] be
So [is]
the [one]
treasuring up
for himself
and
not
toward
God
being rich
He said
then
to
the
disciples
of Him
Because of
this
I say
to you
not
be anxious
for the
life
what
you should eat
nor
for the
body
what
you should put on
The
for
life
more than
is
the
food
and
the
body
than the
clothing
Consider
the
ravens
that
not
they sow
nor
reap
to them
not
there is
a storehouse
nor
barn
and
-
God
feeds
them
How much
more
you
are valuable
than the
birds
Which
now
of
you
being anxious
is able
to
the
lifespan
of him
to add
one hour
If
then
not even
[the] least
you are able [to do]
why
about
the
rest
are you anxious
Consider
the
lilies
how
Not
do they labor
nor
do they spin
I say
however
to you
not even
Solomon
in
all
the
glory
of him
was arrayed
as
one
of these
If
however
in [the]
field
the
grass
being [here]
today
and
tomorrow
into
the furnace
being thrown
-
God
thus
clothes
how much
more
you
O [you] of little faith
And
you
not
seek
what
you might eat
and
what
you might drink
and
not
be in suspense
these things
for
all
the
nations
of the
world
seek after
of you
now
the
Father
knows
that
you have need
of these
But
seek you
the
kingdom
of Him
and
these things
will be added
to you
Not
fear
-
little
flock
for
took delight
the
Father
of you
to give
you
the
kingdom
Sell
the
possessions
of you
and
give
alms
make
to yourselves
purses
not
growing old
a treasure
unfailing
in
the
heavens
where
thief
not
does draw near
nor
moth
destroy
Where
for
is
the
treasure
of you
there
also
the
heart
of you
will be
Let be
your
-
waist
girded about
and
the
lamps
burning
and
you
like
to men
waiting for
the
master
of themselves
whenever
he shall return
from
the
wedding feasts
that
having come
and
having knocked
immediately
they might open
to him
Blessed [are]
the
servants
those
whom
having come
the
master
will find
watching
Truly
I say
to you
that
he will gird himself
and
will make recline
them
and
having come up
will serve
them
And if
in
the
second
and if
in
the
third
watch
he comes
and
finds [them]
thus
blessed
are
those
This
however
know
that
if
had known
the
master of the house
in what
hour
the
thief
is coming
not
-
he would have allowed
to be broken into
the
house
of him
Also
you
be
ready
for
in the
hour
not
you expect
the
Son
-
of Man
comes
Said
then
-
Peter
Lord
to
us
the
parable
this
speak You
or
also
to
all
And
said
the
Lord
Who
then
is
the
faithful
manager
[and] the
wise
whom
will set
the
master
over
the
care [of servants]
of him
-
to give [them]
in
season
the
measure of food
Blessed [is]
the
servant
that
whom
having come
the
master
of him
will find
doing
thus
Of a truth
I say
to you
that
over
all
the
possessions
of him
he will set
him
If
however
should say
the
servant
that
in
the
heart
of him
Delays
the
master
of Me
to come
and
should begin
to beat
the
men-servants
and
the
maid-servants
to eat
also
and
to drink
and
to get drunk
will come
the
master
of the
servant
that
in
a day
in which
not
he does expect
and
in
an hour
that
not
he knows
and
he will cut in two
him
and
the
place
of him
with
the
unbelievers
will appoint
That
now
-
servant
the [one]
having known
the
will
of the
master
of him
and
not
having prepared
nor
having done
according to
the
will
of him
will be beaten with
many [blows]
the [one]
however
not
having known
having done
however
[things] worthy
of stripes
will be beaten with
few
Everyone
now
to whom
has been given
much
much
will be required
from
him
and
to whom
has been committed
much
the more
will they ask of
him
Fire
I came
to cast
upon
the
earth
and
how
I wish
if
already
it be kindled
Baptism
however
I have
to be baptized [with]
and
how
I am distressed
until
while
it should be accomplished
Think you
that
peace
I came
to give
on
the
earth
No
I say
to you
but
rather
division
There will be
for
from
-
now
five
in
one
house
divided
three
against
two
and
two
against
three
They will be divided
father
against
son
and
son
against
father
mother
against
daughter
and
daughter
against
-
mother
mother-in-law
against
the
daughter-in-law
of her
and
daughter-in-law
against
-
mother-in-law
He was saying
now
also
to the
crowds
When
you see
cloud
rising up
from
[the] west
immediately
you say
-
A shower
is coming
and
it happens
so
And
when
a south wind
is blowing
you say
-
Heat
there will be
and
it happens
Hypocrites
The
appearance
of the
earth
and
of the
sky
you know [how]
to discern
the
time
however
this
how
not
to discern
Why
now
even
for
yourselves
not
judge you
what [is]
right
As
for
you are going
with
the
adversary
of you
before
a magistrate
in
the
way
give
earnestness
to be set free
from
him
lest
ever
he should drag away
you
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
you
will deliver
to the
officer
and
the
officer
you
will cast
into
prison
I say
to you
no
not
shall you come out
from there
until
even
the
last
lepton
you shall have paid
Were present
now
some
at
the same
-
time
telling
Him
about
the
Galileans
of whom
the
blood
Pilate
had mingled
with
the
sacrifices
of them
And
answering
He said
to them
Think you
that
-
Galileans
these
sinners
beyond
all
the
Galileans
were
because
such things
they have suffered
No
I say
to you
but
if
not
you repent
all
likewise
you will perish
Or
those
-
ten [and]
eight
on
whom
fell
the
tower
in
-
Siloam
and
killed
them
think you
that
these
debtors
were
beyond
all
the
men
-
dwelling
in Jerusalem
No
I say
to you
but
if
not
you repent
all
likewise
you will perish
He was speaking
then
this
-
parable
A fig tree
had
a certain [man]
planted
in
the
vineyard
of him
and
he came
seeking
fruit
on
it
and
not
did find [any]
He said
then
to
the
vinedresser
Behold
three
years
throughout
these
I come
seeking
fruit
on
the
fig tree
this
and
not
do find [any]
Cut down
it
that
why
even
the
ground
should it use up
-
And
answering
he says
to him
Sir
let alone
it
also
this
the
year
until
when
I shall dig
around
it
and
put [in]
manure
and if
indeed
it should bear
fruit
in
the [time]
so be it
If
however
not
you will cut down
it
He was
now
teaching
in
one
of the
synagogues
on
the
Sabbaths
And
behold
a woman
a spirit
having
of infirmity
years
ten [and]
eight
And
she was
bent over
and
not
able
to lift up herself
to
the
full
Having seen
then
her
-
Jesus
called [her] near
and
said
to her
Woman
you have been freed from
the
sickness
of you
And
He laid
upon her
the
hands
and
immediately
she was made straight
and
began to glorify
-
God
Answering
now
the
ruler of the synagogue
indignant
because
on the
Sabbath
had healed
-
Jesus
he was saying
to the
crowd
-
Six
days
there are
in
which
it behooves
to work
in
these
therefore
coming
be healed
and
not
on the
day
of the
Sabbath
Answered
therefore
him
the
Lord
and
said
Hypocrites
Each one
of you
on the
Sabbath
not
does he untie
the
ox
of him
or
the
donkey
from
the
stall
and
having led [it] away
give [it] to drink
This
now
a daughter
of Abraham
being
whom
has bound
-
Satan
behold
ten
and
eight
years
not
ought [she]
to be loosed
from
the
bond
this
on the
day
of the
Sabbath
And
these things
on saying
of Him
were ashamed
all
those
opposed
to Him
and
all
the
crowd
was rejoicing
at
all
the
glorious things
that
were being done
by
Him
He was saying
then
To what
like
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
to what
shall I liken
it
Like
it is
to a grain
of mustard
which
having taken
a man
cast
into
garden
his
and
it grew
and
came
into
a tree
and
the
birds
of the
air
encamped
in
the
branches
of it
And
again
He said
To what
shall I liken
the
kingdom
-
of God
Like
it is
to leaven
which
having taken
a woman
hid
in
of meal
measures
three
until
it
was leavened
all
And
He was going through
by
towns
and
villages
teaching
and
progress
making
toward
Jerusalem
Said
then
one
to Him
Lord
if
[are] few
those
being saved
-
And
He said
to
them
Strive
to enter in
through
the
narrow
door
for
many
I say
to you
will seek
to enter in
and
not
will be able
From
what
-
shall have risen up
the
master of the house
and
shall have shut
the
door
then
you should begin
outside
to stand
and
to knock
at the
door
saying
Lord
open
to us
And
he answering
will say
to you
Not
I do know
you
from where
are
Then
will you begin
to say
We ate
in presence
of you
and
drank
and
in
the
streets
of us
you taught
And
he will say
I tell
you
not
I do know
from where
you are
depart
from
me
all [you]
workers
of unrighteousness
There
will be
the
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of the
teeth
when
you see
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
and
all
the
prophets
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
you
however
are being cast
out
And
they will come
from
east
and
west
and
from
north
and
south
and
will recline
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
behold
there are
last
who
will be
first
and
there are
first
who
will be
last
In
same
the
hour
came near
certain
Pharisees
saying
to Him
Go out
and
proceed
from here
for
Herod
desires
You
to kill
And
He said
to them
Having gone
say
to the
fox
that
Behold
I cast out
demons
and
cures
I complete
today
and
tomorrow
and
the
third [day]
I am perfected
But
it behooves
Me
today
and
tomorrow
and
the [day]
following
to proceed
for
not
it is possible [for]
a prophet
to perish
outside of
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
-
killing
the
prophets
and
stoning
those
having been sent
to
her
how often
I have wanted
to gather
those
children
of you
that
way
a hen [gathers]
-
her
brood
under
the
wings
and
not
you were willing
Behold
is left
to you
the
house
of you
I say
now
to you
no
not
shall you see
Me
until
[the time] comes
when
you say
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
And
it came to pass
on
the
going
of Him
into
a house
of one
of the
rulers
of the
Pharisees
on a Sabbath
to eat
bread
and
they
were
watching
Him
And
behold
a man
certain
there was
with dropsy
before
Him
And
answering
-
Jesus
spoke
to
the
lawyers
and
to [the] Pharisees
saying
Is it lawful
on the
Sabbath
to heal
or
not
-
But
they were silent
And
having taken hold [of him]
He healed
him
and
let [him] go
And
to
them
He said
Which
of you
a son
or
an ox
into
a pit
will fall
also
not
immediately
he will pull up
him
on
day
the
Sabbath
And
not
they were able
to reply
to
these things
He was speaking
then
to
those
having been invited
a parable
remarking
how
the
first places
they were choosing out
saying
to
them
When
you are invited
by
anyone
to
wedding feasts
not
do recline
in
the
first place
lest
ever
[one] more honorable
than you
might have been
invited
by
him
and
having come
the [one]
you
and
him
having invited
will say
to you
Give
to this one
[your] place
and
then
you should begin
with
shame
the
last
place
to take
But
when
you are invited
having gone
recline
in
the
last
place
so that
when
might come
the [one]
having invited
you
he will say
to you
Friend
come up
higher
Then
will be
to you
glory
before
all
those
reclining
[with] you
For
everyone
-
exalting
himself
will be humbled
and
the [one]
humbling
himself
will be exalted
He was saying
then
also
to the [one]
having invited
Him
When
you make
a dinner
or
a supper
not
call
-
friends
of you
nor
the
brothers
of you
nor
the
relatives
of you
nor
neighbors
rich
lest
ever
also
they
should invite in return
you
and
be made
recompense
to you
But
when
a feast
you make
call
the poor
the crippled
the lame
the blind
and
blessed
you will be
because
nothing
they have
to repay
you
It will be recompensed
for
to you
in
the
resurrection
of the
righteous
Having heard
then
one
of those
reclining with [Him]
these things
he said
to Him
Blessed [is he]
who
will eat
bread
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
-
But
He said
to him
A man
certain
was preparing
a supper
great
and
invited
many
And
he sent
the
servant
of him
at the
hour
of the
supper
to say
to those
having been invited
Come
for
now
ready
[it] is
And
began
with
one [voice]
all
to excuse themselves
The
first
said
to him
A field
I have bought
and
I have
need
going out
to see
it
I beg of
you
hold
me
excused
And
another
said
Yoke
of oxen
I have bought
five
and
I am going
to prove
them
I beg of
you
hold
me
excused
And
another
said
A wife
I have married
and
because of
this
not
I am able
to come
And
having come
the
servant
reported
to the
master
of him
these things
Then
having become angry
the
master of the house
said
to
servant
of him
Go out
quickly
into
the
streets
and
lanes
of the
city
and
the
poor
and
crippled
and
blind
and
lame
bring in
here
And
said
the
servant
Sir
it has been done
as
you did command
and
still
room
there is
And
said
the
master
to
the
servant
Go out
into
the
highways
and
hedges
and
compel [them]
to come in
so that
may be filled
of me
the
house
I say
for
to you
that
not one
the
men
of those
-
having been invited
will taste
of me
the
supper
Were going with
then
Him
crowds
great
and
having turned
He said
to
them
If
anyone
comes
to
Me
and
not
hates
the
father
of himself
and
the
mother
and
the
wife
and
the
children
and
the
brothers
and
the
sisters
yes
and
even
the
life
of him
not
he is able
to be
of Me
disciple
Whoever
not
carries
the
cross
of himself
and
comes
after
Me
not
is able
to be
My
disciple
Which
for
of
you
desiring
a tower
to build
not
first
having sat down
counts
the
cost
whether
he has
for
[its] completion
Thus
not
ever
he having laid
of it
a foundation
and
not
being able
to finish
all
-
seeing [it]
may begin
him
to mock
saying
-
This
-
man
began
to build
and
not
was able
to finish
Or
what
king
proceeding
with another
king
to engage
in
war
not
having sat down
first
will take counsel
whether
able
he is
with
ten
thousand
to meet
the [one]
with
twenty
thousand
coming
against
him
If
now
not
still
of him
far off
being
an embassy
having sent
he asks
-
for
peace
So
therefore
every one
of
you
who
not
does give up
all
that
he himself
possesses
not
is able
to be
My
disciple
Good [is]
therefore
the
salt
if
however
even
the
salt
becomes tasteless
with
what
will it be seasoned
Neither
for
soil
nor
for
manure
fit
is it
out
they cast
it
The [one]
having
ears
to hear
let him hear
Were
now
to Him
drawing near
all
the
tax collectors
and
the
sinners
to hear
Him
And
were grumbling
the
both
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
saying
-
This [man]
sinners
receives
and
eats with
them
He spoke
then
to
them
the
parable
this
saying
What
man
of
you
having
a hundred
sheep
and
having lost
of
them
one
not
leaves
the
ninety
nine
in
the
open field
and
goes
after
the [one]
having been lost
until
he finds
it
And
having found [it]
he lays [it]
on
the
shoulders
of him
rejoicing
And
having come
to
the
house
he calls together
the
friends
and
the
neighbors
saying
to them
Rejoice with
me
for
I have found
the
sheep
of me
the [one]
having been lost
I say
to you
that
in the same way
joy
in
-
heaven
there will be
over
one
sinner
repenting
rather than
over
ninety
nine
righteous ones
who
no
need
have
of repentance
Or
what
woman
drachmas
having
ten
if
she should lose
drachma
one
not
lights
a lamp
and
sweeps
the
house
and
seeks
carefully
until
it
she finds
And
having found [it]
she calls together
the
friends
and
neighbors
saying
Rejoice with
me
for
I have found
the
drachma
that
I lost
Thus
I say
to you
there is
joy
before
the
angels
-
of God
over
one
sinner
repenting
He said
then
A man
certain
had
two
sons
And
said
the
younger
of them
to
[the] father
Father
give
to me
the
falling [to me]
portion
of the
property
-
And
he divided
between them
the
property
And
after
not
many
days
having gathered together
all
the
younger
son
went away
into
a country
distant
and
there
he wasted
the
estate
of him
living
prodigally
Having spent
however
of him
all
there arose
a famine
severe
throughout
the
country
that
and
he
began
to be in need
And
having gone
he joined himself
to one
of the
citizens
the
country
of that
and
he sent
him
into
the
fields
of him
to feed
pigs
And
he was longing
to fill
the
belly
of him
from
the
pods
that
were eating
the
pigs
and
no one
was giving
to him
To
himself
however
having come
he was saying
How many
hired servants
of the
father
of me
have abundance
of bread
I
however
with hunger
here
am perishing
Having risen up
I will go
to
the
father
of me
and
I will say
to him
Father
I have sinned
against
-
heaven
and
before
you
no longer
am I
worthy
to be called
son
of you
Make
me
like
one
of the
servants
of you
And
having risen up
he went
to
the
father
of himself
Still
now
he
far
being distant
saw
him
the
father
of him
and
was moved with compassion
and
having run
fell
upon
the
neck
of him
and
kissed
him
Said
then
the
son
to him
Father
I have sinned
against
-
heaven
and
before
you
no longer
am I
worthy
to be called
son
of you
Said
then
the
father
to
the
servants
of him
Quickly
bring out
robe
the
best
and
clothe
him
and
give
a ring
for
the
hand
of him
and
sandals
for
his
feet
and
having brought
the
calf
-
fattened
kill [it]
and
having eaten
let us be merry
For
this
-
son
of mine
dead
was
and
is alive again
he was
lost
and
is found
And
they began
to be merry
Was
now
the
son
of him
the
elder
in
[the] field
and
while
coming [up]
he drew near
to the
house
he heard
music
and
dancing
And
having called near
one
of the
servants
he began inquiring
what
-
might be
these things
-
And
he said
to him
-
The
brother
of you
is come
and
has killed
the
father
of you
the
calf
-
fattened
because
in good health
him
he has received
He was angry
however
and
not
was willing
to go in
-
And
the father
of him
having gone
was begging
him
-
And
answering
he said
to
[the] father
Behold
so many
years
I serve
you
and
never
a commandment
of you
I disobeyed
and
to me
never
did you give
a young goat
that
with
the
friends
of me
I might make merry
When
however
the
son
of you
this
the [one]
having devoured
your
-
living
with
prostitutes
came
you have killed
for him
the
fattened
calf
-
And
he said
to him
Son
you
always
with
me
are
and
all
that
[is] mine
yours
is
To make merry
however
and
to rejoice
it was fitting
because
the
brother
of you
this
dead
was
and
is alive again
and
he was lost
and
is found
He was saying
now
also
to
the
disciples
A man
certain
there was
rich
who
had
a manager
and
he
was accused
unto him
as
is wasting
the
possessions
of him
And
having called
him
he said
to him
What [is]
this
I hear
concerning
you
Give
the
account
of the
stewardship
of you
not
for
you are able
any longer
to manage
Said
then
within
himself
the
manager
What
shall I do
for
the
master
of me
is taking away
the
management
from
me
To dig
not
I am able
to beg
I am ashamed
I know
what
I will do
so that
when
I shall have been removed
from
the
management
they might receive
me
into
the
homes
of them
And
having called to [him]
one
each
of the
debtors
of the
master
of him
he was saying
to the
first
How much
owe you
to
master
of me
-
And
he said
A hundred
baths
of oil
-
And
he said
to him
Take
your
the
bill
and
having sat down
quickly
write
fifty
Then
to another
he said
You
now
how much
owe
-
And
he said
A hundred
cors
of wheat
He says
to him
Take
your
-
bill
and
write
eighty
And
praised
the
master
the
manager
-
unrighteous
because
shrewdly
he had acted
For
the
sons
of the
age
this
more shrewd
than
the
sons
of the
light
in
the
generation
-
of themselves
are
And
I
to you
say
for yourselves
make
friends
by
the
wealth
-
of unrighteousness
that
when
it fails
they might receive
you
into
the
eternal
dwellings
The [one]
faithful
with
very little
also
with
much
faithful
is
and
the [one]
with
very little
unrighteous
also
with
much
unrighteous
is
If
therefore
in
the
unrighteous
wealth
faithful
not
you have been
the
true [riches]
who
to you
will entrust
And
if
in
that which [is]
of another
faithful
not
you have been
that which
[is] yours
who
will give
to you
No
servant
is able
two
masters
to serve
either
for
the
one
he will hate
and
the
other
he will love
or
one
he will be devoted to
and
the
other
he will despise
Not
you are able
God
to serve
and
money
Were listening to
now
these things
all
the
Pharisees
lovers of money
being
and
they were ridiculing
Him
And
He said
to them
You
are
those
justifying
themselves
before
-
men
-
but
God
knows
the
hearts
of you
for
that which
among
men
[is] exalted
[is] an abomination
before
-
God
The
law
and
the
prophets [were]
until
John
from
that time
the
kingdom
-
of God
is proclaimed
and
everyone
into
it
forces his way
Easier for
however
it is
the
heaven
and
the
earth
to pass away
than
of the
law
one
stroke of a pen
to fail
Everyone
-
putting away
the
wife
of him
and
marrying
another
commits adultery
And
the [one]
her put away
from
a husband
marrying
commits adultery
A man
now
certain
there was
rich
and
he was clothed in
purple
and
fine linen
making good cheer
every
day
in splendor
A poor man
now
certain
named
Lazarus
was laid
at
the
gate
of him
being full of sores
and
desiring
to be fed
from
that
falling
from
the
table
of the
rich man
but
even
the
dogs
coming
were licking
the
sores
of him
It came to pass that
then
died
the
poor man
and
was carried away
he
by
the
angels
into
the
bosom
of Abraham
Died
then
also
the
rich man
and
was buried
And
in
-
Hades
having lifted up
the
eyes
of him
being
in
torment
he sees
Abraham
from
afar
and
Lazarus
in
the
bosom
of him
And
he
having cried out
said
Father
Abraham
have mercy on
me
and
send
Lazarus
that
he might dip
the
tip
of the
finger
of him
in water
and
cool
the
tongue
of me
for
I am suffering
in
the
flame
this
Said
then
Abraham
Child
remember
that
you did fully receive
the [things]
good
of you
in
the
lifetime
of you
and
Lazarus
likewise
the [things]
evil
Now
however
here
he is comforted
you
now
are suffering
And
besides
all
these things
between
us
and
you
a chasm
great
has been fixed
so that
those
desiring
to pass
from here
to
you
not
are able
nor
from there
to
us
can they pass
He said
then
I implore
you
then
father
that
you would send
him
to
the
house
of the
father
of me
I have
for
five
brothers
so that
he might warn
them
that
not
also
they
might come
to
the
place
this
-
of torment
Says
however
Abraham
They have
Moses
and
the
prophets
let them hear
them
-
And
he said
No
father
Abraham
but
if
one
from
[the] dead
should go
to
them
they will repent
He said
however
to him
If
Moses
and
the
prophets
not
they hear
not even
if
one
out from
[the] dead
should rise
will they be persuaded
He said
then
to
the
disciples
of Him
Impossible
it is
for
the
stumbling blocks
not
to come
woe [to him]
but
by
whom
they come
It is better
for him
if
a stone
of a mill
is hung
around
the
neck
of him
and
he is thrown
into
the
sea
than
that
he should cause to stumble
-
little
of these
one
Take heed
to yourselves
If
should sin
the
brother
of you
rebuke
him
and
if
he should repent
forgive
him
And
if
seven times
in the
day
he should sin
against
you
and
seven times
should return
to
you
saying
I repent
you shall forgive
him
And
said
the
apostles
to the
Lord
Add
to us
faith
Said
then
the
Lord
If
you have
faith
like
a grain
of mustard
you would have said
-
to the
mulberry tree
this
Be uprooted
and
be planted
in
the
sea
and
it would have obeyed
-
you
Which
now
of
you
a servant
having
plowing
or
shepherding
the [one]
having come in
out of
the
field
will say
to him
Immediately
having come
recline
But
not
will he say
to him
Prepare
what
I may eat
and
having girded yourself about
serve
me
while
I eat
and
drink
and
after
these things
shall eat
and
drink
you
Not
is he
thankful
to the
servant
because
he did
the things
having been commanded
Thus
also
you
when
you may have done
all
the [things]
having been commanded
you
say
-
Servants
unworthy
are we
that which
we were bound
to do
we have done
And
it came to pass
in
the
going up
to
Jerusalem
that
He
was passing
through
[the] midst
of Samaria
and
Galilee
And
on entering
of Him
into
a certain
village
met
ten
leprous
men
who
stood
afar off
And
they
lifted up
[their] voice
saying
Jesus
Master
have compassion on
us
And
having seen [them]
He said
to them
Having gone
show
yourselves
to the
priests
And
it came to pass
in
the
going
them
they were cleansed
One
then
of
them
having seen
that
he was healed
turned back
with
a voice
loud
glorifying
-
God
and
he fell
on
[his] face
at
the
feet
of Him
giving thanks
to Him
and
he
was
a Samaritan
Having answered
then
-
Jesus
said
Not
the
ten
were cleansed
-
But
the nine
are where
None
was there found
having returned
to give
glory
-
to God
if
not
the
foreigner
this
And
He said
to him
Having risen up
go forth
the
faith
of you
has cured
you
Having been asked
now
by
the
Pharisees
when
is coming
the
kingdom
-
of God
He answered
them
and
said
Not
comes
the
kingdom
-
of God
with
careful observation
nor
will they say
Behold
here
or
There
Behold
for
the
kingdom
-
of God
in the midst
of you
is
He said
then
to
the
disciples
Will come
days
when
you will desire
one
of the
days
of the
Son
-
of Man
to see
and
not
you will see [it]
And
they will say
to you
Behold
there
Behold
here
Not
go forth
nor
follow
As
for
the
lightning
flashing
from
the [one end]
of
the
sky
to
the [other end]
of the
sky
shines
thus
will be
the
Son
-
of Man
in
the
day
of Him
First
however
it behooves
Him
many things
to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
the
generation
this
And
as
it came to pass
in
the
days
of Noah
thus
will it be
also
in
the
days
of the
Son
of
man
They were eating
they were drinking
they were marrying
they were being given in marriage
until
that
day
entered
Noah
into
the
ark
and
came
the
flood
and
destroyed
all
Likewise
as
it came to pass
in
the
days
of Lot
they were eating
they were drinking
they were buying
they were selling
they were planting
they were building
in that
then
day
went out
Lot
from
Sodom
it rained
fire
and
brimstone
from
heaven
and
destroyed
all
According
-
to these
will it be
in that
day
the
Son
-
of Man
is revealed
In
that
-
day
the [one who]
will be
on
the
housetop
and
the
goods
of him
in
the
house
not
let him come down
to take away
them
and
the [one]
in
[the] field
likewise
not
let him return
to
the things
behind
Remember
the
wife
of Lot
Whoever
if
may seek
the
life
of him
to save
will lose
it
also
whoever
-
will lose [it]
will preserve
it
I say
to you
in that
-
night
there will be
two
upon
bed
one
The
one
will be taken
and
the
other
will be left
There will be
two [women]
grinding
at
the
same [place]
The
one
will be taken
-
and
the other
will be left
And
answering
they say
to Him
Where
Lord
-
And
He said
to them
Where
the
body [is]
there
also
the
vultures
will be gathered together
He was speaking
then
a parable
to them
about
the [way]
it behooves
always
to pray
them
and
not
to lose heart
saying
A judge
certain
there was
in
a certain
city
-
God
not
fearing
and
man
not
respecting
A widow
then
there was
in
the
city
that
and
she was coming
to
him
saying
Avenge
me
of
the
adversary
of me
And
not
he would
for
a time
afterward
he
however
said
within
himself
If
even
-
God
not
I fear
nor
man
respect
because
yet
-
causes
me
trouble
the
widow
this
I will avenge
her
so that
not
to
end
coming
she exhaust
me
Said
then
the
Lord
Hear
what
the
judge
-
unrighteous
says
-
And
God
no
not
shall execute
the
avenging
of the
elect
of Him
the [ones]
crying out
to Him
day
and
night
and
be deferring
in regard to
them
I say
to you
that
He will execute
the
avenging
of them
in
quickness
Nevertheless
the
Son
-
of Man
having come
indeed
will He find
-
faith
on
the
earth
He spoke
now
also
to
some
-
trusting
in
themselves
that
they are
righteous
and
despising
the
others
the
parable
this
Men
two
went up
into
the
temple
to pray
the
one
a Pharisee
and
the
other
a tax collector
The
Pharisee
having stood
thus
toward
himself
was praying
-
God
I thank
You
that
not
I am
like
the
rest
of the
men
swindlers
unrighteous
adulterers
or
even
like
this
-
tax collector
I fast
twice
in the
week
I tithe
all things
as many as
I gain
-
But
the tax collector
afar off
standing
not
was willing
not even
the
eyes
to lift up
to
-
heaven
but
was striking
the
breast
of himself
saying
-
God
be merciful
to me
the
sinner
I say
to you
went down
this one
justified
to
the
house
of him
rather than
that
For
everyone
-
exalting
himself
will be humbled
the [one]
however
humbling
himself
will be exalted
They were bringing
then
to Him
also
the
infants
that
them
He might touch
having seen
however
the
disciples
were rebuking
them
-
But
Jesus
having called to [Him]
them
said
Permit
the
little children
to come
to
Me
and
not
do forbid
them
of the
for
such
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
Truly
I say
to you
whoever
-
not
shall receive
the
kingdom
-
of God
as
a child
no
not
shall enter
into
it
And
asked
a certain
Him
ruler
saying
Teacher
good
what
having done
life
eternal
will I inherit
Said
then
to him
-
Jesus
Why
Me
call you
good
No one [is]
good
if
not
alone
-
God
The
commandments
You know
Not
shall you commit adultery
not
shall you murder
not
shall you steal
not
shall you bear false witness
you shall honor
the
father
of you
and
the
mother
-
And
he said
These
all
have I kept
from
[the] youth
Having heard
then
-
Jesus
said
to him
Yet
one thing
to you
is lacking
All
as much as
you have
sell
and
distribute
to [the] poor
and
you will have
treasure
in
the
heavens
and
come
follow
Me
-
And
having heard
these things
very sorrowful
he became
he was
for
rich
extremely
Having seen
then
him
-
Jesus
saying
How
difficultly
those
-
riches
having
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
shall enter
Easier
for
it is
a camel
through
an eye
of a needle
to go
than
a rich man
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
to enter
Said
then
those
having heard
Then
who
is able
to be saved
-
But
He said
The things
impossible
with
men
possible
with
-
God
are
Said
then
-
Peter
Behold
we
having left
the
own
followed
You
-
And
He said
to them
Truly
I say
to you
that
no one
there is
who
has left
house
or
wife
or
brothers
or
parents
or
children
for the sake of
the
kingdom
-
of God
who
no
nothing
shall receive
manifold more
in
the
time
this
and
in
the
age
that
is coming
life
eternal
Having taken aside
then
the
Twelve
He said
to
them
Behold
we go up
to
Jerusalem
and
will be accomplished
all things
-
having been written
by
the
prophets
about the
Son
-
of Man
He will be betrayed
for
to the
Gentiles
and
will be mocked
and
will be insulted
and
will be spit upon
And
having flogged [Him]
they will kill
Him
and
on the
day
-
third
He will rise again
And
they
none
of these things
understood
and
was
the
word
this
hidden
from
them
and
neither
they knew
the things
being spoken
It came to pass
then
in
the
drawing near
of Him
to
Jericho
a blind [man]
certain
was sitting
beside
the
road
begging
Having heard
now
a crowd
passing along
he was asking
what
might be
this
They told
then
him
-
Jesus
of
Nazareth
is passing by
And
he called out
saying
Jesus
Son
of David
have mercy on
me
And
those
going before
were rebuking
him
that
he should be silent
He
however
much
more
kept crying out
Son
of David
have mercy on
me
Having stopped
then
-
Jesus
commanded
him
to be brought
to
Him
Having drawn near
then
him
He asked
him
What
to you
desire you
I shall do
-
And
he said
Lord
that
I might receive sight
And
-
Jesus
said
to him
Receive sight
The
faith
of you
has healed
you
And
immediately
he received sight
and
began following
Him
glorifying
-
God
And
all
the
people
having seen [it]
gave
praise
-
to God
And
having entered
He was passing through
-
Jericho
And
behold
a man
by name
called
Zacchaeus
and
he
was
a chief tax collector
and
he [was]
rich
And
he was seeking
to see
-
Jesus
who
He is
and
not
he was able
because of
the
crowd
because
-
in stature
small
he was
And
having run
to
the
front
he went up
into
a sycamore-fig tree
so that
he might see
Him
for
that [way]
He was about
to pass
And
as
He came
to
the
place
having looked up
-
Jesus
said
to
him
Zacchaeus
having hurried
come down
today
for
in
the
house
of you
it behooves
Me
to stay
And
having hurried
he came down
and
received
Him
rejoicing
And
having seen [it]
all
were grumbling
saying
-
With
a sinful
man
He has entered
to stay
Having stood
then
Zacchaeus
said
to
the
Lord
Behold
the
half
of me
of the
possessions
Lord
to the
poor
I give
and
if
of anyone
anything
I have defrauded
I restore [it]
fourfold
Said
then
to
him
-
Jesus
-
Today
salvation
to the
house
this
has come
because
also
he
a son
of Abraham
is
Came
for
the
Son
-
of Man
to seek
and
to save
that
having been lost
Were hearing
while
they
these things
having proceeded
He spoke
a parable
because
-
near
being
Jerusalem
of His
and
thinking
their
that
immediately
is about
the
kingdom
-
of God
to appear
He said
therefore
A man
certain
of noble birth
proceeded
to
a country
distant
to receive
for himself
a kingdom
and
to return
Having called
then
ten
servants
of himself
he gave
to them
ten
minas
and
said
to
them
Do business
until
that
I come back
-
But
the citizens
of him
hated
him
and
sent
a delegation
after
him
saying
Not
we are willing [for]
this [man]
to reign
over
us
And
it came to pass
on
the
returning
of him
having received
the
kingdom
that
he directed
to be called
to him
the
servants
these
to whom
he had given
the
money
in order that
he might know
each
what
had gained by trading
Came up
then
the
first
saying
Lord
the
mina
of you
ten
has produced
more minas
And
He said
to him
Well done
good
servant
Because
in
very little
faithful
you were
to be
having authority
you are
over
ten
cities
And
came
the
second
saying
The
mina
of you
Lord
has made
five
minas
He said
then
also
to this one
And
you
over
are to be
five
cities
And
-
another
came
saying
Lord
behold
the
mina
of you
which
I kept
lying away
in
a piece of cloth
I was afraid
for
of you
because
a man
harsh
you are
You take up
what
not
you did lay down
and
you reap
what
not
you did sow
He says
to him
Out of
the
mouth
of you
I will judge
you
evil
servant
You knew
that
I
a man
harsh
am
taking up
what
not
I did lay down
and
reaping
what
not
I did sow
Then
because of
why
not
did you give
of me
the
money
to
[the] bank
and I
having come
with
interest
-
it
might have collected
And
to those
standing by
he said
Take
from
him
the
mina
and
give [it]
to the [one]
the
ten
minas
having
And
they said
to him
Master
he has
ten
minas
I say
to you
that
to everyone
-
having
will be given
from
however
the [one]
not
having
even
that which
he has
will be taken away
Furthermore
the
enemies
of mine
these
those
not
having been willing [for]
me
to reign
over
them
bring
here
and
slay
them
before
me
And
having said
these things
He went on
ahead
going up
to
Jerusalem
And
it came to pass
as
He drew near
to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
toward
the
mount
-
called
Olivet
He sent
two
of the
disciples
saying
Go
into
the
ahead
village
in
which
entering
you will find
a colt
having been tied
on
which
no one
ever yet
of men
has sat
and
having untied
it
bring [it]
And
if
anyone
you
asks
Because of
why
do you untie [it]
thus
will you say
Because
the
Lord
of it
need
has
Having departed
then
those
having been sent
found [it]
as
He had said
to them
On untying
then
of them
the
colt
said
the
masters
of it
to
them
Why
untie you
the
colt
-
And
they said
-
The
Lord
of it
need
has
And
they led
it
to
-
Jesus
and
having cast
their
-
garments
on
the
colt
they put on [it]
-
Jesus
Going
then
of Him
they were spreading
the
garments
of them
on
the
road
Drawing near
then
of Him
already
at
the
descent
of the
Mount
-
of Olives
began
all
the
multitude
of the
disciples
rejoicing
to praise
-
God
in a voice
loud
for
all
which
they had seen
[the] mighty works
saying
Blessed is
the
coming
-
King
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
In
heaven
peace
and
glory
in
[the] highest
And
some
of the
Pharisees
from
the
crowd
said
to
Him
Teacher
rebuke
the
disciples
of You
And
answering
He said
I say
to you
if
these
will be silent
the
stones
will cry out
And
as
He drew near
having seen
the
city
He wept
over
it
saying
-
If
you had known
in
the
day
this
even
you
the things
for
peace
Now
however
they are hidden
from
eyes
of you
For
will come
days
upon
you
that
will cast around
the
enemies
of you
a barricade
you
and
they will surround
you
and
will hem in
you
on every side
and
will level to the ground
you
and
the
children
of you
within
you
and
not
will leave
a stone
upon
a stone
within
you
in place of
which
not
you knew
the
season
the
of visitation
of you
And
having entered
into
the
temple
He began
to cast out
those
selling
saying
to them
It has been written
And
will be
the
house
of Me
a house
of prayer
You
however
it
have made
a den
of robbers
And
He was
teaching
-
every
day
in
the
temple
the
however
chief priests
and
the
scribes
were seeking
Him
to destroy
and
the
foremost
of the
people
And
not
they found
-
what
they might do
the
people
for
all
were hanging on
His [words]
listening
And
it came to pass
on
one
of the
days
as was teaching
He
the
people
in
the
temple
and
proclaiming the gospel
came up
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
with
the
elders
and
spoke
saying
to
Him
Tell
us
by
what
authority
these things
You do
or
who
is
the [one]
having given
to You
the
authority
this
Answering
now
He said
to
them
Will ask
you
I also
one thing
and
you tell
Me
The
baptism
of John
from
heaven
was it
or
from
men
-
And
they reasoned
among
themselves
saying
-
If
we should say
From
heaven
He will say
Because of
why
not
did you believe
him
If
however
we should say
From
men
the
people
all
will stone
us
having been persuaded
for
they are
John
a prophet
to be
And
they answered
not
they knew
from where
And
-
Jesus
said
to them
Neither
I
tell
you
by
what
authority
these things
I am doing
He began
then
to
the
people
to speak
the
parable
this
A man
planted
a vineyard
and
rented
it
to farmers
and
went abroad
a time
long
And
[in the] season
he sent
to
the
farmers
a servant
that
from
the
fruit
of the
vineyard
they will give
to him
-
But
the farmers
sent away
him
having beaten [him]
empty-handed
And
he proceeded
another
to send
a servant
-
but
him
having beaten
and
having dishonored
they sent away
empty-handed
And
he proceeded
a third
to send
-
then
also
him
having wounded
they cast out
Said
then
the
master
of the
vineyard
What
shall I do
I will send
the
son
of me
the
beloved
perhaps
him
they will respect
Having seen
now
him
the
farmers
began reasoning
among
themselves
saying
This
is
the
heir
let us kill
him
so that
ours
might become
the
inheritance
And
having cast forth
him
outside
the
vineyard
they killed [him]
What
therefore
will do
to them
the
master
of the
vineyard
He will come
and
will destroy
the
farmers
these
and
will give
the
vineyard
to others
Having heard [it]
then
they said
Never
may it be
-
But
having looked at
them
He said
What
then
is
that
has been written
this
[The] stone
which
rejected
those
building
this
has become
into
[the] head
of [the] corner
Everyone
-
falling
on
that
-
stone
will be broken
on
whomever
but
-
it might fall
it will grind into powder
him
And
sought
the
scribes
and
the
chief priests
to lay
on
Him
-
hands
in
that
-
hour
and
they feared
the
people
they perceived
for
that
against
them
He was speaking
the
parable
this
And
having watched [Him]
they sent
spies
feigning
themselves
righteous
to be
that
they might catch
Him
in talk
in order
to deliver
Him
to the
rule
and
to the
authority
of the
governor
And
they questioned
Him
saying
Teacher
we know
that
rightly
You speak
and
teach
and
not
receive
[any] person
but
on the basis of
truth
the
way
-
of God
teach
Is it lawful
for us
to Caesar
tribute
to give
or
not
Having perceived
however
of them
the
craftiness
He said
to
them
Show
Me
a denarius
Of whom
has it
[the] image
and
inscription
-
And
they said
Caesarâs
-
And
He said
to
them
Therefore
give back
the things
of Caesar
to Caesar
and
the things
-
of God
-
to God
And
not
they were able
to catch Him in
His
word
before
the
people
and
having marveled
at
the
answer
of Him
they became silent
Having approached
then
some
of the
Sadducees
the ones
denying
a resurrection
not
there is
they questioned
Him
saying
Teacher
Moses
wrote
to us
if
anyoneâs
brother
should die
having
a wife
and
he
childless
is
that
should take
the
brother
of him
the
wife
and
should raise up
seed
to the
brother
of him
Seven
therefore
brothers
there were
and
the
first
having taken
a wife
died
childless
and
the
second
and
the
third
took
her
likewise
then
also
the
seven
not
did leave
children
and
died
Finally
also
the
woman
died
The
woman
therefore
in
the
resurrection
of which
of them
does she become
wife
-
For
the seven
had
her
as wife
And
said
to them
-
Jesus
The
sons
of the
age
this
marry
and
are given in marriage
those
however
having been considered worthy
to the
age
that which [is]
to obtain
and
the
resurrection
which [is]
out from
[the] dead
neither
marry
nor
are given in marriage
neither
for
to die
any more
are they able
like [the] angels
for
they are
and
sons
they are
of God
of the
resurrection
sons
being
That
however
are raised
the
dead
even
Moses
showed
at
the
bush
when
he calls
[the] Lord
the
God
of Abraham
and
God
of Isaac
and
God
of Jacob
God
now
not
He is
of [the] dead
but
of [the] living
all
for
to Him
live
Answering
now
some
of the
scribes
said
Teacher
well
you have spoken
No longer
then
did they dare
to ask
Him
anything
He said
then
to
them
How
do they declare
the
Christ
to be
of David
Son
Himself
for
David
says
in
[the] book
of Psalms
Said
[the] Lord
to the
Lord
of me
Sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
the
enemies
of You
[as] a footstool
of the
feet
of You
David
therefore
Him
Lord
calls
and
how
of him
son
is He
Were listening
now
all
the
people
He said
to the
disciples
Beware
of
the
scribes
-
desiring
to walk
in
long robes
and
loving
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
first seats
in
the
synagogues
and
first places
in
the
banquets
who
devour
the
houses
of
widows
and
as a pretext
at great length
pray
These
will receive
more abundant
condemnation
Having looked up
now
He saw
the ones
casting
into
the
treasury
the
gifts
of them
rich
He saw
then
a certain
widow
poor
casting
in
lepta
two
And
He said
Truly
I say
to you
that
the
widow
this
-
poor
more
than all
has cast in
all
for
these
out of
that which
was abounding
to them
cast
in
the
gifts
she
however
out of
the
poverty
of her
all
the
livelihood
that
she had
did cast
And
as some
were speaking
about
the
temple
that
with stones
goodly
and
consecrated gifts
it was adorned
He said
[As to] these things
which
you are beholding
will come
[the] days
in
which
not
will be left
stone
upon
stone
which
not
will be thrown down
They asked
then
Him
saying
Teacher
when
then
these things
will be
and
what [will be]
the
sign
when
are about
these things
to take place
-
And
He said
Take heed
lest
you be led astray
many
for
will come
in
the
name
of Me
saying
I
am [He]
and
The
time
is drawn near
Not
go
after
them
When
then
you should hear of
wars
and
commotions
not
be terrified
it behooves
for
these things
to take place
first
but
not
immediately [is]
the
end
Then
He was saying
to them
Will rise up
nation
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
Earthquakes
both
great
and
in different
places
famines
and
pestilences
there will be
fearful sights
also
and
from
heaven
signs
great
will there be
Before
however
these things
all
they will lay
upon
you
the
hands
of them
and
will persecute [you]
delivering [you]
to
the
synagogues
and
prisons
bringing [you]
before
kings
and
governors
on account of
the
name
of Me
It will result
to you
for
a testimony
Settle
therefore
in
the
minds
of you
not
to premeditate
to make a defense
I
for
will give
you
a mouth
and
wisdom
which
not
will be able
to resist
nor
to reply to
all
those
opposing
you
You will be betrayed
then
even
by
parents
and
brothers
and
relatives
and
friends
and
they will put to death
[some] from among
you
And
you will be
hated
by
all
because of
the
name
of Me
But
a hair
of
the
head
of you
no
not
should perish
By
the
patient endurance
of you
you will gain
the
souls
of you
When
then
you see
being encircled
by
encampments
Jerusalem
then
know
that
has drawn near
the
desolation
of her
Then
those
in
-
Judea
let them flee
to
the
mountains
and
those
in
midst
of her
let them depart out
and
those
in
the
countries
not
let them enter
into
her
for
[the] days
of avenging
these
are
-
to fulfill
all things
-
having been written
But woe
to those
in
womb
having
and
to the [ones]
nursing
in
those
the
days
there will be
for
distress
great
upon
the
land
and
wrath
to the
people
this
And
they will fall
by [the] edge
of [the] sword
and
will be led captive
into
the
nations
all
and
Jerusalem
will be
trodden down
by
[the] Gentiles
until
that
are fulfilled
[the] times
of [the] Gentiles
And
there will be
signs
in
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
upon
the
earth
distress
of nations
with
perplexity
[the] roaring
of [the] sea
and
rolling surge
fainting
men
from
fear
and
expectation
of that which
is coming
on the
earth
-
for
the powers
of the
heavens
will be shaken
And
then
will they see
the
Son
-
of Man
coming
in
a cloud
with
power
and
glory
great
Beginning
then
of these things
to come to pass
look up
and
lift up
the
heads
of you
because
draws near
the
redemption
of you
And
He spoke
a parable
to them
Behold
the
fig tree
and
all
the
trees
When
they sprout
already
looking [on them]
for
yourselves
you know
that
already
near
the
summer
is
So
also
you
when
you see
these things
coming to pass
know
that
near
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
Truly
I say
to you
that
no
not
will have passed away
the
generation
this
until
-
all [these things]
shall have taken place
The
heaven
and
the
earth
will pass away
-
but
the words
of Me
no
not
will pass away
Take heed
now
to yourselves
lest
ever
be burdened
of you
the
hearts
with
dissipation
and
drunkenness
and
cares
of life
and
would come
upon
you
suddenly
the
day
that
as
a snare
It will come
for
upon
all
those
sitting
upon
the face
of all
the
earth
Watch
also
at
every
season
praying
that
you may have strength
to escape
these things
all
that
are about
to come to pass
and
to stand
before
the
Son
-
of Man
He was
now
during the
day
in
the
temple
teaching
-
and
the evening
going out
He was lodging
on
the
mount
-
called
Olivet
And
all
the
people
would come early in the morning
to
Him
in
the
temple
to hear
Him
Was drawing near
now
the
Feast
of
Unleavened [Bread]
-
called
Passover
And
were seeking
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
-
how
they might put to death
him
they were afraid
for
of the
people
Entered
then
Satan
into
Judas
the [one]
being called
Iscariot
being
of
the
number
of the
Twelve
And
having gone away
he spoke with
the
chief priests
and
captains
the
how
to them
he might betray
Him
And
they rejoiced
and
agreed
him
money
to give
And
he promised
and
began seeking
opportunity
-
to betray
Him
apart from
[a] crowd
to them
Came
then
the
day
of
Unleavened [Bread]
which
it was necessary for
to be sacrificed
the
Passover lamb
And
He sent
Peter
and
John
having said
Having gone
prepare
for us
the
Passover
that
we might eat [it]
-
And
they said
to Him
Where
will You
we should prepare
-
And
He said
to them
Behold
having entered
of you
into
the
city
will meet
you
a man
a pitcher
of water
carrying
follow
him
into
the
house
into
which
he enters
and
you shall say
to the
master
of the
house
Says
to you
the
Teacher
Where
is
the
guest room
where
the
Passover
with
the
disciples
of Me
I may eat
And he
you
will show
an upper room
large
furnished
there
prepare
Having gone
then
they found [it]
as
He had said
to them
and
they prepared
the
Passover
And
when
was come
the
hour
He reclined
and
the
apostles
with
Him
And
He said
to
them
With desire
I have desired
this
-
Passover
to eat
with
you
before
-
I
suffer
I say
for
to you
that
no longer
never
not
will I eat
thereof
until
when
it is fulfilled
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
having received
[the] cup
having given thanks
He said
Take
this
and
divide [it]
among
yourselves
I say
for
to you
no
not
will I drink
from
-
now
of
the
fruit
of the
vine
until
that
the
kingdom
-
of God
shall come
And
having taken
[the] bread
having given thanks
He broke [it]
and
gave
to them
saying
This
is
the
body
of Me
which
for
you
is given
this
do
in
the
of Me
remembrance
and
the
cup
likewise
after
which
having supped
saying
This
-
cup [is]
the
new
covenant
in
the
blood
of Me
which
for
you
is being poured out
But
behold
the
hand
of him
betraying
Me
[is] with
Me
on
the
table
For
the
Son
indeed
of
man
according to
that
having been determined
goes
but
woe
to the
man
that
by
whom
He is betrayed
And
they
began
to question
among
themselves
-
who
then
it might be
of
them
who
this
is about
to do
There was
then
also
a dispute
among
them
-
which
of them
is thought
to be
[the] greatest
-
And
He said
to them
The
kings
of the
Gentiles
rule over
them
and
those
exercising authority over
them
benefactors
are called
You
however
not
thus [shall be]
Instead
the
greatest
among
you
let him be
as
the
younger
and
the [one]
leading
as
the [one]
serving
Who
for
[is] greater
the [one]
reclining
or
the [one]
serving
[Is] not
the [one]
reclining
I
however
in
[the] midst
of you
am
as
the [One]
serving
You
now
are
those
having remained
with
Me
in
the
trials
of Me
And I
appoint
to you
as
appointed
to Me
the
Father
of Me
a kingdom
so that
you may eat
and
may drink
at
the
table
of Me
in
the
kingdom
of Me
and
may sit
on
thrones
the
twelve
tribes
judging
of
Israel
Simon
Simon
Behold
-
Satan
demanded to have
all of you
-
to sift
like
-
wheat
I
however
begged
for
you
that
not
may fail
the
faith
of you
and
you
when
you have turned back
strengthen
the
brothers
of you
-
And
he said
to Him
Lord
with
You
ready
I am
both
to
prison
and
to
death
to go
-
And
He said
I tell
you
Peter
not
will crow
today
[the] rooster
until
three times
Me
you will deny
not
knowing
And
He said
to them
When
I sent
you
without
purse
and
bag
and
sandals
not
anything
did you lack
-
And
they said
Nothing
He said
then
to them
But
now
the [one]
having
a purse
let him take [it]
likewise
also
a bag
and
the [one]
not
having
let him sell
the
cloak
of him
and
buy [one]
a sword
I say
for
to you
that
this
which
has been written
it behooves
to be accomplished
in
Me
-
And
with
the lawless
He was reckoned
And
for
the things
concerning
Me
an end
have
-
And
they said
Lord
behold
swords
here [are]
two
-
And
He said
to them
Enough
it is
And
having gone forth
He went
according to
the
custom
to
the
Mount
-
of Olives
followed
then
Him
also
the
disciples
Having come
then
to
the
place
He said
to them
Pray
not
to enter
into
temptation
And
He
withdrew
from
them
about
a stoneâs
throw
and
having fallen on
the
knees
He was praying
saying
Father
if
You are willing
take away
this
-
cup
from
Me
Yet
not
the
will
of Me
but
-
of You
be done
Appeared
then
to Him
an angel
from
heaven
strengthening
Him
And
having been
in
agony
more earnestly
He was praying
And
became
the
sweat
of Him
like
great drops
of blood
falling down
upon
the
ground
And
having risen up
from
the
prayer
having come
to
the
disciples
He found
sleeping
them
from
the
grief
and
He said
to them
Why
are you sleeping
Having risen up
pray
that
not
you might enter
into
temptation
While still
of Him
speaking
behold
a crowd
and
he who
is called
Judas
one
of the
Twelve
was going before
them
and
he drew near
-
to Jesus
to kiss
Him
Jesus
then
said
to him
Judas
with a kiss
the
Son
-
of Man
are you betraying
Having seen
then
those
around
Him
what
would be
they said
Lord
if
will we strike
with [the]
sword
And
struck
one
a certain
of
them
of the
high priest
the
servant
and
cut off
the
ear
his
-
right
Answering
now
-
Jesus
said
Allow you
as far as
thus
And
having touched
the
ear
He healed
him
Said
then
Jesus
to
those
having come out
against
Him
chief priests
and
captains
of the
temple
and
elders
As
against
a robber
have you come out
with
swords
and
clubs
Every
day
being
of Me
with
you
in
the
temple
not
did you stretch out
the
hands
against
Me
but
this
is
of you
the
hour
and
the
power
of the
darkness
Having seized
then
Him
they led [Him] away
and
led [Him]
into
the
house
of the
high priest
-
And
Peter
was following
afar off
They having kindled
then
a fire
in
[the] midst
of the
courtyard
and
having sat down together
was sitting
-
Peter
among
them
Having seen
then
him
a servant girl
certain
sitting
by
the
light
and
having looked intently on
him
she said
Also
this one
with
Him
was
-
But
he denied [it]
saying
Not
I do know
Him
woman
And
after
a little
another
having seen
him
was saying
Also
you
of
them
are
-
But
Peter
was saying
Man
not
I am
And
having elapsed
about
hour
one
other
a certain
strongly affirmed [it]
saying
Of
a truth
also
this one
with
Him
was
also
for
a Galilean
he is
Said
however
-
Peter
Man
not
I know
what
you say
And
immediately
while
he was speaking
of him
crowed
the rooster
And
having turned
the
Lord
looked at
-
Peter
and
remembered
-
Peter
the
word
of the
Lord
how
He had said
to him
-
Before
[the] rooster
crows
today
you will deny
Me
three times
And
having gone forth
outside
he wept
bitterly
And
the
men
who
are holding
Him
began mocking
Him
beating [Him]
And
having blindfolded
Him
they were questioning [Him]
saying
Prophesy
who
is
the [one]
having struck
You
And
other things
many
blaspheming
they were saying
to
Him
And
when
it became
day
were gathered together
the
elderhood
of the
people
chief priests
both
and
scribes
and
they led
Him
into
the
council
of them
saying
If
You
are
the
Christ
tell
us
He said
then
to them
If
you
I should tell
no
not
would you believe
if
then
I should ask [you]
no
not
would you answer
From
-
now on
also
will be
the
Son
-
of Man
sitting
at
[the] right hand
of the
power
-
of God
They said
then
all
You
then
are
the
Son
-
of God
-
And
to
them
He was saying
You
say
that
I
am
-
And
they said
What
any more
have we
of witness
need
We ourselves
for
have heard [it]
from
the
mouth
of Him
And
having risen up
all
the
multitude
of them
led
Him
to
-
Pilate
They began
then
to accuse
Him
saying
This [man]
we found
misleading
the
nation
of us
and
forbidding
tribute
to Caesar
to be given
and
declaring
Himself
Christ
a king
to be
-
And
Pilate
questioned
Him
saying
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
-
And
answering
him
He was saying
You
say
-
And
Pilate
said
to
the
chief priests
and
the
crowds
Not
find I
guilt
in
the
man
this
-
But
they kept insisting
saying
-
He stirs up
the
people
teaching
throughout
all
-
of Judea
and
He has begun
from
-
Galilee
even to
here
Pilate
now
having heard
asked
whether
the
man
a Galilean
is
and
having learned
that
from
the
jurisdiction
of Herod
He is
he sent up
Him
to
Herod
being
also
he himself
in
Jerusalem
in
those
-
days
-
And
Herod
having seen
-
Jesus
[was] glad
exceedingly
he was
for
of
a long
time
wishing
to see
Him
because of
-
hearing
concerning
Him
and
he was hoping
some
sign
to see
by
Him
done
He kept questioning
then
Him
in
words
many
He
however
nothing
answered
him
Had been standing by
now
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
vehemently
accusing
Him
Having set at naught
then
Him
-
Herod
with
the
troops
of him
and
having mocked [Him]
having put on [Him]
apparel
splendid
sent back
him
to
Pilate
Became
then
friends
-
both
Herod
and
-
Pilate
on
that
-
day
with
one another
previously it had been that
for
at
enmity
they were
between
themselves
Pilate
then
having called together
the
chief priests
and
the
rulers
and
the
people
said
to
them
You brought
to me
the
man
this
as
misleading
the
people
and
behold
I
before
you
having examined [Him]
nothing
found
in
the
man
this
guilty
of that
accusation you are bringing
against
Him
No
not even
Herod [did]
he sent back
for
Him
to
us
And
behold
nothing
worthy
of death
is
done
by Him
Having chastised
therefore
Him
I will release [Him]
They cried out
however
all together
saying
Away with
this [man]
release
now
to us
-
Barabbas
who
was
on account of
insurrection
a certain
having been made
in
the
city
and
murder
having been cast
into
the
prison
Again
therefore
-
Pilate
called
to them
wishing
to release
-
Jesus
-
But
they were crying out
saying
Crucify
crucify
Him
-
And
a third [time]
he said
to
them
What
for
evil
did commit
this [man]
No
cause
of death
found I
in
Him
Having chastised
therefore
Him
I will release [Him]
-
But
they were urgent
with voices
loud
asking for
Him
to be crucified
And
were prevailing
the
voices
of them
and
Pilate
sentenced
to be done
the
demand
of them
He released
then
the [one]
on account of
insurrection
and
murder
having been cast
into
prison
whom
they had asked for
-
and
Jesus
he delivered
to the
will
of them
And
as
they led away
Him
having laid hold on
Simon
a certain
of Cyrene
coming
from
the country
they put upon
him
the
cross
to carry
behind
-
Jesus
Were following
now
Him
a great
multitude
of the
people
and
of women
who
were mourning
and
lamenting for
Him
Having turned
then
to
them
Jesus
said
Daughters
of Jerusalem
not
weep
for
Me
but
for
yourselves
weep
and
for
the
children
of you
For
behold
are coming
days
in
which
they will say
Blessed [are]
the
barren
and
the
wombs
that
never
did bear
and
breasts
that
never
nursed
Then
They will begin
to say
to the
mountains
Fall
upon
us
and
to the
hills
Cover
us
For
if
in
green
tree
these things
they do
in
the
dry
what
might take place
Were being led away
now
also
other
criminals
two
with
Him
to be put to death
And
when
they came
to
the
place
-
called
The Skull
there
they crucified
Him
and
the
criminals
one
-
on [the]
right
one
now
on
[the] left
-
And
Jesus
was saying
Father
forgive
them
not
for
they know
what
they do
Dividing
then
the
garments
of Him
they cast
lots
And
stood
the
people
beholding
Were deriding [Him]
then
also
the
rulers
saying
Others
He saved
let Him save
Himself
if
this
is
the
Christ
-
of God
the
Chosen [One]
Mocked
then
Him
also
the
soldiers
coming near
sour wine
offering
Him
and
saying
If
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
save
Yourself
There was
now
also
an inscription
over
Him
The
King
of the
Jews
This
One
now
of the
having been hanged
criminals
was railing at
Him
Not
you are
if
the
Christ
Save
Yourself
and
us
Answering
now
the
other
was rebuking
him
saying
Not even
do fear
you
-
God
that
under
the
same
judgment
you are
and
we
indeed
justly
Worthy
for
of what
we did
we are receiving
[this] man
however
nothing
wrong
did
And
he was saying
Jesus
remember
me
when
You come
into
the
kingdom
of You
And
He said
to him
Truly
to you
I say
today
with
Me
you will be
in
-
Paradise
And
it was
now
about
[the] hour
sixth
and
darkness
came
over
all
the
land
until
[the] hour
ninth
The
sun
was darkened
was torn
then
the
veil
of the
temple
in [the] middle
And
having called out
in a voice
loud
-
Jesus
said
Father
into
[the] hands
of You
I commit
the
Spirit
of Me
This
now
having said
He breathed His last
Having seen
now
the
centurion
that
having taken place
he began glorifying
-
God
saying
Certainly
the
man
this
righteous
was
And
all
the
having come together
crowds
to
the
spectacle
this
having seen
the things
having taken place
beating
the
breasts
were returning [home]
Stood
now
all
those who
knew
Him
from
afar off
also
women
those
having followed
Him
from
-
Galilee
beholding
these things
And
behold
a man
named
Joseph
a Council member
being
a man
good
and
righteous
he
not
was
having consented
to the
counsel
and
the
deed
of them
from
Arimathea
a city
of the
Jews
who
was waiting for
the
kingdom
-
of God
He
having gone
-
to Pilate
asked [for]
the
body
-
of Jesus
And
having taken it down
he wrapped
it
in a linen cloth
and
placed
it
in
a tomb
cut in a rock
in which
no
had been
no one
not yet
laid
And
[the] Day
it was
of Preparation
and
Sabbath
was just beginning
Having followed
then
the
women
who
were
come
out of
-
Galilee
with Him
saw
the
tomb
and
how
was laid
the
body
of Him
Having returned
then
they prepared
spices
and
anointing oils
And
on the
indeed
Sabbath
they rested
according to
the
commandment
The
however
first [day]
of the
week
dawn
very early
to
the
tomb
they came
bringing
that
they had prepared
spices
They found
then
the
stone
having been rolled away
from
the
tomb
Having entered
however
not
they found
the
body
of the
Lord
Jesus
And
it came to pass
while
-
are perplexed
they
about
this
that
behold
men
two
stood by
them
in
garments
dazzling
Terrified
then
having become
of them
and
bowing
the
faces
to
the
ground
they said
to
them
Why
seek you
the
living
among
the
dead
Not
He is
here
but
He is risen
Remember
how
He spoke
to you
yet
being
in
-
Galilee
saying
The
Son
-
of Man
-
it behooves
to be delivered
into
hands
of men
sinful
and
to be crucified
and
the
third
day
to arise
And
they remembered
the
words
of Him
And
having returned
from
the
tomb
they related
these things
all
to the
eleven
and
to all
the
rest
It was
now
-
Magdalene
Mary
and
Joanna
and
Mary
the [mother]
of James
and
the
other women
with
them
telling
to
the
apostles
these things
And
appeared
before
them
like
folly
the
words
of them
and
they did not believe
them
-
But
Peter
having risen up
ran
to
the
tomb
and
having stooped down
he sees
the
linen strips
only
and
he went away
in
himself
wondering at
that
having come to pass
And
behold
two
of
them
on
same
the
day
were
going
to
a village
being distant
stadia
sixty
from
Jerusalem
whose
name [is]
Emmaus
and
they
were talking
with
one another
about
all
-
having taken place
these things
And
it came to pass
in
the
talking
of them
and
reasoning
that
Himself
Jesus
having drawn near
was walking along with
them
-
but
the eyes
of them
were held
-
not
to know
Him
He said
then
to
them
What
-
words [are]
these
that
you exchange
with
one another
walking
And
they stood still
looking sad
Answering
now
[the] one
named
Cleopas
said
to
Him
You
alone
visit
Jerusalem
and
not
have known
the things
having come to pass
in
it
in
the
days
these
And
He said
to them
What things
-
And
they said
to Him
The things
concerning
Jesus
of
Nazareth
who
was
a man
a prophet
mighty
in
deed
and
word
before
-
God
and
all
the
people
that
then
delivered up
him
the
chief priests
and
the
rulers
of us
to
[the] judgment
of death
and
crucified
Him
We
however
were hoping
-
He
it is
who
is about
to redeem
-
Israel
But
indeed
also
with
all
these things
[the] third
this
day
brings
away from
which
these things
came to pass
However
also
women
certain
out from
us
astonished
us
Having been
early
to
the
tomb
and
not
having found
the
body
of Him
they came
declaring
also
a vision
of angels
to have seen
who
say
He
is alive
And
went
some
of those
with
us
to
the
tomb
and
found [it]
so
as
also
the
women
said
Him
however
not
they saw
And
He
said
to
them
O
foolish
and
slow
-
of heart
-
to believe
in
all
that
have spoken
the
prophets
Not
these things
was it necessary for
to suffer
the
Christ
and
to enter
into
the
glory
of Him
And
having begun
from
Moses
and
from
all
the
Prophets
He interpreted
to them
in
all
the
Scriptures
the things
concerning
Himself
And
they drew near
to
the
village
where
they were going
and
He
appeared
farther
to be going
And
they constrained
Him
saying
Abide
with
us
for
toward
evening
it is
and
has declined
now
the
day
And
He entered in
-
to abide
with
them
And
it came to pass
in
the
reclining
of Him
with
them
having taken
the
bread
He blessed [it]
and
having broken [it]
He began giving [it]
to them
Of them
then
were opened
the
eyes
and
they knew
Him
And
He
vanished
being seen
from
them
And
they said
to
one another
Not
the
heart
of us
burning
was
within
us
as
He was speaking
with us
on
the
road
as
He was opening
to us
the
Scriptures
And
having risen up
[that] same
-
hour
they returned
to
Jerusalem
and
they found
gathered together
the
eleven
and
those
with
them
saying
-
Indeed
has risen
the
Lord
and
He has appeared
to Simon
And
they
began relating
the things
on
the
road
and
how
He was known
to them
in
the
breaking
of the
bread
These things
now
of them
as they were telling
He Himself
stood
in
midst
of them
and
says
to them
Peace
to you
Having been terrified
however
and
filled with fear
having been
they were thinking [themselves]
a spirit
to see
And
He said
to them
Why
troubled
are you
and
through
why
doubts
do come up
in
the
hearts
of you
See
the
hands
of Me
and
the
feet
of Me
that
I
am
He
Touch
Me
and
see
for
a spirit
flesh
and
bones
not
has
as
Me
you see
having
And
this
having said
He showed
to them
the
hands
and
the
feet
Still
now
while they were disbelieving
of them
for
the
joy
and
amazement
He said
to them
Have you
anything
to eat
here
-
And
they gave
to Him
of a fish
broiled
part
And
having taken [it]
before
them
He ate [it]
He said
now
unto
to them
These [are]
the
words
of me
which
I spoke
to
you
still
being
with
you
that
it behooves
to be fulfilled
all things
-
having been written
in
the
law
of Moses
and
the
Prophets
and
[the] Psalms
concerning
Me
Then
He opened
their
-
mind
-
to understand
the
Scriptures
And
He said
to them
-
Thus
it has been written
Was to suffer
the
Christ
and
to rise
out from
[the] dead
the
third
day
and
to be proclaimed
in
the
name
of Him
repentance
and
forgiveness
of sins
to
all
-
nations
having begun
from
Jerusalem
You
witnesses
of these things
And
behold
I
am sending
the
promise
of the
Father
of Me
upon
you
you
however
remain
in
the
city
until
that
you should be clothed with
from
on high
power
He led
now
them
as far as
to
Bethany
and
having lifted up
the
hands
of Him
He blessed
them
And
it came to pass
in
the
blessing
of Him
them
He was separated
from
them
and
was carried up
into
-
heaven
And
they
having worshiped
Him
returned
to
Jerusalem
with
joy
great
and
were
continually
all
in
the
temple
blessing
-
God
In [the]
beginning
was
the
Word
and
the
Word
was
with
-
God
and
God
was
the
Word
He
was
in [the]
beginning
with
-
God
All things
through
Him
came into being
and
without
Him
came into being
not even
one [thing]
that
has come into being
In
Him
life
was
and
the
life
was
the
light
-
of men
And
the
Light
in
the
darkness
shines
and
the
darkness
it
not
overcame
There came
a man
having been sent
from
God
[the] name
to Him
[was] John
He
came
as
a witness
that
he might testify
concerning
the
Light
that
all
might believe
through
him
Not
was
He
the
Light
but
that
he might witness
concerning
the
Light
Was
the
Light
-
true
who
enlightens
every
man
coming
into
the
world
In
the
world
He was
and
the
world
through
Him
came into being
and
the
world
Him
not
knew
To
the
own
He came
and
the
own
Him
not
received
As many as
however
received
Him
He gave
to them
authority
children
of God
to be
to those
believing
in
the
name
of Him
who
not
of
blood
nor
of
will
of flesh
nor
of
will
of man
but
of
God
were born
And
the
Word
flesh
became
and
dwelt
among
us
and
we beheld
the
glory
of Him
a glory
as
of an only begotten
from
[the] Father
full
of grace
and
truth
John
witnesses
concerning
Him
and
he cried out
saying
This
was He
of whom
I was saying
The [One]
after
me
coming
precedence
over me
has
because
before
me
He was
For
from
the
fullness
of Him
we
all
have received
then
grace
for
grace
For
the
law
through
Moses
was given
-
grace
and
-
truth
through
Jesus
Christ
came
God
no one
has seen
ever yet
[the] only begotten
God
the [One]
being
in
the
bosom
of the
Father
He
has made [Him] known
And
this
is
the
testimony
-
of John
when
sent
to
him
the
Jews
from
Jerusalem
priests
and
Levites
that
they might ask
him
You
who
are
And
he confessed
and
not
denied
but
confessed
-
I
not
am
the
Christ
And
they asked
him
What
then
You
Elijah
are
And
he says
Not
I am
The
prophet
are
you
And
he answered
No
They said
therefore
to him
Who
are you
That
an answer
we might give
to those
having sent
us
what
say you
about
yourself
He was saying
I [am]
a voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
Make straight
the
way
of [the] Lord
as
said
Isaiah
the
prophet
And
[those] having been sent
were
out from
the
Pharisees
And
they asked
him
and
said
to him
Why
then
baptize you
if
you
not
are
the
Christ
nor
Elijah
nor
the
prophet
Answered
them
-
John
saying
I
baptize
with
water
but in [the] midst
of you
stands [One]
whom
you
not
know
the [One]
after
me
coming
of whom
not
am
I
worthy
that
I should untie
of Him
the
strap
of the
sandal
These things
in
Bethany
took place
across
the
Jordan
where
was
-
John
baptizing
On the
next day
he sees
-
Jesus
coming
to
him
and
says
Behold
the
Lamb
-
of God
-
taking away
the
sin
of the
world
He
it is
concerning
whom
I
said
After
me
comes
a man
who
precedence
over me
has
because
before
me
He was
And I
not
knew
Him
but
that
He might be revealed
-
to Israel
because of
this
came
I
with
water
baptizing
And
bore witness
John
saying
-
I have beheld
the
Spirit
descending
as
a dove
out of
heaven
and
it remained
upon
Him
And I
not
knew
Him
but
the [One]
having sent
me
to baptize
with
water
He
to me
said
Upon
whom
-
you shall see
the
Spirit
descending
and
abiding
on
Him
He
is
the [One]
baptizing
with
[the] Spirit
Holy
And I
have seen
and
have borne witness
that
this
is
the
Son
-
of God
On the
next day
again
was standing
-
John
and
of
the
disciples
of him
two
And
having looked at
-
Jesus
walking
he says
Behold
the
Lamb
-
of God
And
heard
the
two
disciples
him
speaking
and
followed
-
Jesus
Having turned
then
-
Jesus
and
having beheld
them
following
He says
to them
What
seek you
-
And
they said
to Him
Rabbi
which
is to say
being translated
Teacher
where
are You staying
He says
to them
Come
and
you will see
They went
therefore
and
saw
where
He abides
and
with
Him
they stayed
the
day
that
[The] hour
was
about
[the] tenth
Was
Andrew
the
brother
of Simon
Peter
one
of
the
two
-
having heard
from
John
and
having followed
Him
Finds
he
first
the
brother
-
own
Simon
and
he says
to him
We have found
the
Messiah
which
is
translated
Christ
He led
him
to
-
Jesus
Having looked at
him
-
Jesus
said
You
are
Simon
the
son
of John
You
will be called
Cephas
which
means
Peter
On the
next day
He desired
to go forth
into
-
Galilee
And
He finds
Philip
And
says
to him
-
Jesus
Follow
Me
Was
now
-
Philip
from
Bethsaida
from
the
city
of Andrew
and
Peter
Finds
Philip
-
Nathanael
and
says
to him
[Him] whom
wrote of
Moses
in
the
Law
also
the
prophets
we have found
Jesus
son
-
of Joseph
-
of
Nazareth
And
said
to him
Nathanael
Out of
Nazareth
is able
any
good thing
to be
Says
to him
-
Philip
Come
and
see
Saw
Jesus
-
Nathanael
coming
to
Him
and
He says
concerning
him
Behold
truly
an Israelite
in
whom
deceit
not
there is
Says
to Him
Nathanael
From where
me
know You
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
Before
-
you
Philip
calling
being
under
the
fig tree
I saw
you
Answered
Him
Nathanael
Rabbi
You
are
the
Son
-
of God
You
King
are
-
of Israel
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
Because
I said
to you
that
I saw
you
under
the
fig tree
believe you
Greater things
than these
You will see
And
He says
to him
Truly
truly
I say
to all of you
you will see
the
heaven
opened
and
the
angels
-
of God
ascending
and
descending
on
the
Son
-
of Man
And
on the
day
-
third
a wedding
took place
in
Cana
-
of Galilee
and
was
the
mother
-
of Jesus
there
Was invited
then
also
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
to
the
wedding
And
having been deficient
of wine
says
the
mother
-
of Jesus
to
Him
Wine
not
they have
And
says
to her
-
Jesus
What
to Me
and
to you
woman
Not yet
is come
the
hour
of Me
Says
the
mother
of Him
to the
servants
Whatever
anyhow
-
He may say
to you
do
There were
now
there
of stone
water jars
six
according to
the
purification
of the
Jews
standing
having space
for
metretae
two
or
three
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Fill
the
jars
with water
And
they filled
them
up to
[the] brim
And
He says
to them
Draw out
now
and
carry
to the
master of the feast
-
And
they carried [it]
When
then
had tasted
the
master of the feast
the
water
wine
having become
and
not
he knew
from where
it is
the
however
servants
knew
-
having drawn
the
water
calls
the
bridegroom
the
master of the feast
and
says
to him
Every
man
first
the
good
wine
sets out
and
when
they might have drunk freely
the
inferior
you
have kept
the
good
wine
until
now
This
did
[the] beginning
of the
signs
-
Jesus
in
Cana
-
of Galilee
and
He revealed
the
glory
of Him
and
believed
in
Him
the
disciples
of Him
After
this
He went down
to
Capernaum
He
and
the
mother
of Him
and
the
brothers
and
the
disciples
of Him
and
there
they stayed
not
many
days
And
near
was
the
Passover
of the
Jews
and
went up
to
Jerusalem
-
Jesus
And
He found
in
the
temple
those
selling
oxen
and
sheep
and
doves
and
the
money changers
sitting
And
having made
a whip
of
cords
all
He drove out
from
the
temple
-
both
sheep
and
-
oxen
and
of the
money changers
He poured out
the
coins
and
the
tables
He overthrew
And
to those
-
doves
selling
He said
Take
these things
from here
not
make
the
house
of the
Father
of Me
a house
of trade
Remembered
the
disciples
of Him
that
written
it is
The
zeal
of the
house
of You
will consume
Me
Answered
therefore
the
Jews
and
said
to Him
What
sign
show You
to us
that
these things
You do
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
Destroy
the
temple
this
and
in
three
days
I will raise up
it
Said
therefore
the
Jews
Forty
and
six
years
was built
the
temple
this
and
You
in
three
days
will raise up
it
He
however
was speaking
concerning
the
temple
of the
body
of Him
When
therefore
He was raised up
out from
[the] dead
remembered
the
disciples
of Him
that
this
He had said
and
they believed
the
Scripture
and
the
word
that
had spoken
-
Jesus
When
then
He was
in
-
Jerusalem
in
the
Passover
in
the
Feast
many
believed
in
the
name
of Him
beholding
of Him
the
signs
that
He was doing
On His part
however
Jesus
not
did entrust
Himself
to them
because of
-
His
knowing
all [men]
and
because
no
need
He had
that
anyone
should testify
concerning
the
man
He Himself
for
knew
what
was
in
the
man
There was
now
a man
of
the
Pharisees
Nicodemus
name
to him
a ruler
of the
Jews
He
came
to
Him
by night
and
said
to Him
Rabbi
we know
that
from
God
You have come
a teacher
no one
for
is able
these
-
signs
to do
that
You
do
if
not
should be
-
God
with
him
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
anyone
be born
from above
not
he is able
to see
the
kingdom
-
of God
Says
to
Him
-
Nicodemus
How
is able
a man
to be born
old
being
Not
is he able
into
the
womb
of the
mother
of him
a second time
to enter
and
to be born
Answered
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
anyone
be born
of
water
and
of [the] Spirit
not
he is able
to enter
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
That
having been born
of
the
flesh
flesh
is
and
that
having been born
of
the
Spirit
spirit
is
Not
do wonder
that
I said
to you
It is necessary for
you [all]
to be born
from above
The
wind
where
it wishes
blows
and
the
sound
of it
You hear
but
not
you know
from where
it comes
and
where
it goes
thus
is
everyone
-
having been born
of
the
Spirit
Answered
Nicodemus
and
said
to Him
How
are able
these things
to be
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
You
are
the
teacher
-
of Israel
and
these things
not
know
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
what
we know
we speak
and
what
we have seen
we bear witness to
and
the
witness
of us
not
you people receive
If
things
earthly
I have told
you
and
not
you believe
how
if
I tell
to you
the things
heavenly
will you believe
And
no one
has gone up
into
-
heaven
if
not
the [One]
out of
-
heaven
having come down
the
Son
-
of Man
And
as
Moses
lifted up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
thus
to be lifted up
it behooves
the
Son
-
of Man
so that
everyone
-
believing
in
Him
may have
life
eternal
Thus
for
loved
-
God
the
world
that
the
Son
the
only begotten
He gave
so that
everyone
-
believing
in
Him
not
should perish
but
should have
life
eternal
Not
for
sent
-
God
-
His Son
into
the
world
that
He might judge
the
world
but
that
might be saved
the
world
through
Him
The [one]
believing
on
Him
not
is judged
the [one]
not
believing
already
has been judged
because
not
he has believed
in
the
name
of the
only begotten
Son
-
of God
This
now
is
the
judgement
that
the
Light
has come
into
the
world
and
loved
-
men
rather
the
darkness
than
the
Light
were
for
of them
evil
the
deeds
Everyone
for
-
evil
practicing
hates
the
Light
and
not
comes
to
the
Light
so that
not
may be exposed
the
works
of him
the [one]
however
practicing
the
truth
comes
to
the
Light
that
may be manifest
his
-
works
that
in
God
have been
done
After
these things
came
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of Him
into
the
Judean
land
and
there
He was staying
with
them
and
was baptizing
Was
now
also
John
baptizing
in
Aenon
near
-
Salim
because
waters
many
were
there
and
they were coming
and
being baptized
Not yet
for
had been
cast
into
the
prison
John
Arose
then
a debate
among
the
disciples
of John
with
[a certain] Jew
about
purification
And
they came
to
-
John
and
said
to him
Rabbi
He who
was
with
you
beyond
the
Jordan
to whom
you
have borne witness
behold
He
baptizes
and
all
are coming
to
Him
Answered
John
and
said
Nothing
is able
a man
to receive
nothing
if
not
it is
given
to him
from
-
heaven
Yourselves
you
to me
bear witness
that
I said
Not
am
I
the
Christ
but
-
sent
I am
before
Him
The [one]
having
the
bride
[the] bridegroom
is
the
now
friend
of the
bridegroom
the [one]
standing
and
listening for
him
with joy
rejoices
because of
the
voice
of the
bridegroom
This
therefore
the
joy
-
of mine
is fulfilled
Him
it behooves
to increase
me
however
to decrease
The [One]
from above
coming
above
all
is
The [one]
being
from
the
earth
from
the
earth
is
and
from
the
earth
speaks
The [One]
from
-
heaven
coming
above
all
is
What
He has seen
and
heard
this
He testifies
and
the
testimony
of Him
no one
receives
The [one]
having received
His
-
testimony
has set his seal
that
-
God
true
is
He whom
for
sent
-
God
the
words
-
of God
speaks
not
for
by
measure
He gives
the
Spirit
The
Father
loves
the
Son
and
all things
has given
into
the
hand
of Him
The [one]
believing
in
the
Son
has
life
eternal
the [one]
however
not obeying
the
Son
not
will see
life
but
the
wrath
-
of God
abides
on
him
When
therefore
knew
-
Jesus
that
heard
the
Pharisees
that
Jesus
more
disciples
makes
and
baptizes
than
John
although indeed
Jesus
Himself
not
was baptizing
but
the
disciples
of Him
He left
-
Judea
and
went away
again
into
-
Galilee
It was necessary for
now
Him
to pass
through
-
Samaria
He comes
therefore
to
a city
-
of Samaria
called
Sychar
near
the
plot of ground
that
had given
Jacob
Joseph
the
son
of him
Was
now
there
[the] well
-
of Jacob
-
Therefore
Jesus
being wearied
from
the
journey
was sitting
thus
at
the
well
[The] hour
was
about
[the] sixth
Comes
a woman
out of
-
Samaria
to draw
water
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Give
Me
to drink
-
For
the disciples
of Him
had gone away
into
the
city
that
food
they might buy
Says
therefore
to Him
the
woman
-
Samaritan
How
You
a Jew
being
from
me
to drink
do ask
a woman
Samaritan
being
Not
for
have association
Jews
with Samaritans
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to her
If
you had known
the
gift
-
of God
and
who
it is
-
saying
to you
Give
Me
to drink
you
-
would have asked
Him
and
He would have given
-
to you
water
living
Says
to Him
Sir
nothing
to draw with
You have
and
the
well
is
deep
from where
then
have You
the
water
-
living
Not
You
greater than
are
the
father
of us
Jacob
who
gave
us
the
well
and
himself
of
it
drank
and
the
sons
of him
and
the
livestock
of him
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to her
Everyone
-
drinking
of
the
water
this
will thirst
again
whoever
however
-
may drink
of
the
water
that
I
will give
him
never
not
will thirst
to
the
age
Instead
the
water
that
I will give
to him
will become
in
him
a spring
of water
welling up
into
life
eternal
Says
to
Him
the
woman
Sir
give
me
this
-
water
that
not
I might thirst
nor
come
here
to draw
He says
to her
Go
call
the
husband
of you
and
come
here
Answered
the
woman
and
said
Not
I have
a husband
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Correctly
you have spoken
-
A husband
not
I have
Five
for
husbands
you have had
and
now
he whom
you have
not
is
your
husband
this
truly
you have spoken
Says
to Him
the
woman
Sir
I understand
that
a prophet
are
You
The
fathers
of us
on
the
mountain
this
worshiped
and
you
say
that
in
Jerusalem
is
the
place
where
to worship
it is necessary
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Believe
Me
woman
that
is coming
an hour
when
neither
on
the
mountain
this
nor
in
Jerusalem
will you worship
the
Father
You
worship
what
not
you know
we
worship
what
we know
for
-
salvation
of
the
Jews
is
But
is coming
an hour
and
now
is
when
the
true
worshipers
will worship
the
Father
in
spirit
and
truth
also
for
the
Father
such
seeks
who
worship
Him
Spirit
-
God [is]
and
those
worshiping
in
spirit
and
truth
it behooves
to worship
Says
to Him
the
woman
I know
that
Messiah
is coming
who
is called
Christ
when
comes
He
He will tell
us
all things
Says
to her
-
Jesus
I
am [He]
the [One]
speaking
to you
And
upon
this
came
the
disciples
of Him
and
were amazed
that
with
a woman
He was speaking
no one
however
said
What
seek You
Or
Why
speak You
with
her
Left
then
the
water pot
of her
the
woman
and
went away
into
the
city
and
says
to the
men
Come
see
a man
who
told
me
all things
whatever
I did
Can it be [that]
this
is
the
Christ
They went forth
out of
the
city
and
were coming
unto
Him
But in
the
meantime
were asking
Him
the
disciples
saying
Rabbi
eat
-
But
He said
to them
I
food
have
to eat
that
you
not
know
Were saying
therefore
the
disciples
to
one another
No
one
did bring
Him
[anything] to eat
Says
to them
-
Jesus
My
food
is
that
I should do
the
will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
and
should finish
of Him
the
work
Not
you
say
that
yet
four months
it is
and
the
harvest
comes
Behold
I say
to you
lift up
the
eyes
of you
and
see
the
fields
because
white
they are
toward
harvest
already
The [one]
reaping
a reward
receives
and
gathers
fruit
unto
life
eternal
so that
the [one]
sowing
together
may rejoice
and
the [one]
reaping
In
for
this
the
saying
is
true
-
One
is
-
sowing
and
another
-
reaping
I
sent
you
to reap
what
not
you
have toiled for
others
have toiled
and
you
into
the
labor
of them
have entered
Out of
now
the
city
that
many
believed
in
Him
of the
Samaritans
because of
the
word
of the
woman
testifying
-
He told
me
all things
whatever
I did
When
therefore
came
to
Him
the
Samaritans
they were asking
Him
to abide
with
them
and
He stayed
there
two
days
And
many
more
believed
because of
the
word
of Him
-
and
to the woman
they were saying
-
No longer
because of
-
your
speech
we believe
we ourselves
for
have heard
and
we know
that
this
is
truly
the
Savior
of the
world
After
then
the
two
days
He went forth
from there
into
-
Galilee
Himself
for
Jesus
testified
that
a prophet
in
the
own
hometown
honor
not
has
When
therefore
He came
into
-
Galilee
received
Him
the
Galileans
all things
having seen
how great
He had done
in
Jerusalem
during
the
feast
also
themselves
for
they had gone
to
the
feast
He came
therefore
again
to
-
Cana
-
of Galilee
where
He had made
the
water
wine
And
there was
a certain
royal official
whose
-
son
was sick
in
Capernaum
He
having heard
that
Jesus
had come
out of
-
Judea
into
-
Galilee
went
to
Him
and
was asking
that
He would come down
and
heal
his
-
son
he was about
for
to die
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
to
him
If
not
signs
and
wonders
you people see
no
not
will you believe
Says
to
Him
the
royal official
Sir
come down
before
dies
the
child
of me
Says
to him
-
Jesus
Go
the
son
of you
lives
Believed
the
man
the
word
that
said
to him
-
Jesus
and
he went on his way
Already
then
[as] he
is going down
the
servants
met
him
saying
that
the
boy
of him
lives
He inquired
therefore
the
hour
from
them
in
which
better
he got
They said
therefore
to him
-
Yesterday
[at the] hour
seventh
left
him
the
fever
Knew
therefore
the
father
that [it was]
that
the
hour
at
which
said
to him
-
Jesus
The
son
of You
lives
And
he believed
himself
and
the
household
of him
all
This [is]
now
again
[the] second
sign
did
-
Jesus
having come
out of
-
Judea
into
-
Galilee
After
these things
there was
a feast
of the
Jews
and
went up
Jesus
to
Jerusalem
There is
now
in
-
Jerusalem
by
the
Sheep Gate
a pool
-
called
in Hebrew
Bethesda
five
porches
having
In
these
were lying
a multitude
of those
ailing
blind
lame
paralyzed
awaiting
the
of the
water
moving
An angel
for
during
[a certain] season
descended
into
the
pool
and
stirred
the
water
He who
therefore
first
entered
after
the
stirring
of the
water
well
was made
from whatever
at the time
he was held by
disease
Was
now
a certain
man
there
thirty
and
eight
years
being
in
-
infirmity
himself
Him
having seen
-
Jesus
lying
and
having known
that
a long
already
time
he has been
He says
to him
Desire you
well
to become
Answered
Him
the [one]
ailing
Sir
a man
not
I have
that
when
has been stirred
the
water
he might put
me
into
the
pool
in
which
now
am going
I
another
before
me
descends
Says
to him
-
Jesus
Arise
take up
the
mat
of you
and
walk
And
immediately
became
well
the
man
and
he took up
the
mat
of him
and
began to walk
It was
now
Sabbath
on
that
-
day
Were saying
therefore
the
Jews
to the [one]
having been healed
Sabbath
it is
and
not
it is lawful
for you
to take up
the
mat
who
however
answered
them
The [One]
having made
me
well
that One
to me
said
Take up
the
mat
of you
and
walk
They asked
him
Who
is
the
man
-
having said
to you
Take up
and
walk
The [one]
now
having been healed
not
knew
who
it is
-
for
Jesus
had moved away
a crowd
being
in
the
place
After
these things
finds
him
-
Jesus
in
the
temple
and
said
to him
Behold
well
you have become
no more
sin
that
not
worse
to you
something
happens
Went away
the
man
and
told
the
Jews
that
Jesus
it is
the [One]
having made
him
well
And
because of
this
were persecuting
the
Jews
-
Jesus
because
these things
He was doing
on
[the] Sabbath
-
But
answered
them
The
Father
of Me
until
now
is working
and I
am working
Because of
this
therefore
the more
were seeking
Him
the
Jews
to kill
because
not
only
was He breaking
the
Sabbath
but
also
Father
His own
He was calling
-
God
equal
Himself
making
to
God
Answered
therefore
-
Jesus
and
was saying
to them
Truly
truly
I say
to you
not
is able
the
Son
to do
of
Himself
nothing
if
not
anything
He might see
the
Father
doing
whatever
for
-
He
does
these things
also
the
Son
likewise
does
-
For
the Father
loves
the
Son
and
all things
shows
to Him
that
He
does
and
greater
than these
He will show
Him
works
so that
you
may marvel
Even as
for
the
Father
raises up
the
dead
and
gives life
thus
also
the
Son
to whom
He will
gives life
Not even
for
the
Father
judges
no one
but
-
judgment
all
has given
to the
Son
so that
all
may honor
the
Son
even as
they honor
the
Father
He who
not
is honoring
the
Son
not
is honoring
the
Father
the [One]
having sent
Him
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
the [one]
the
word
of Me
hearing
and
believing
the [One]
having sent
Me
he has
life
eternal
and
into
judgment
not
comes
but
has passed
out of
-
death
into
-
life
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
is coming
an hour
and
now
is
when
the
dead
will hear
the
voice
of the
Son
-
of God
and
those
having heard
will live
As
for
the
Father
has
life
in
Himself
so
also
to the
Son
He gave
life
to have
in
Himself
And
authority
He gave
Him
judgment
to execute
because
Son
of Man
He is
Not
marvel at
this
for
is coming
an hour
in
which
all
those
in
the
tombs
will hear
the
voice
of Him
and
will come forth
those
-
good
having done
to
[the] resurrection
of life
-
those
evil
having done
to
[the] resurrection
of judgment
Not
am able
I
to do
of
Myself
nothing
as
I hear
I judge
and
the
judgment
-
of Me
just
is
because
not
I seek
the
will
-
of Me
but
the
will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
If
I
bear witness
concerning
Myself
the
testimony
of Me
not
is
true
Another
it is
-
bearing witness
concerning
Me
and
I know
that
true
is
the
testimony
which
he bears witness
concerning
Me
You
have sent
unto
John
and
he has borne witness
to the
truth
I
now
not
from
man
the
testimony
receive
but
these things
I say
that
you
may be saved
He
was
the
lamp
-
burning
and
shining
you
now
were willing
to rejoice
for
a season
in
the
light
of him
I
however
have
the
testimony
greater than
that
of John
-
For
the works
that
has given
Me
the
Father
that
I should complete
them
same
the
works
which
I do
bear witness
concerning
Me
that
the
Father
Me
has sent
And
the [One]
having sent
Me
[the] Father
Himself
has borne witness
concerning
Me
Neither
voice
of Him
at any time
have You heard
nor
form
of Him
have you seen
And
the
word
of Him
not
you have
in
you
abiding
for
whom
sent
He
Him
you
not
believe
You diligently search
the
Scriptures
for
you
think
in
them
life
eternal
to have
and
these
are they
-
bearing witness
concerning
Me
and
not
you are willing
to come
to
Me
that
life
you may have
Glory
from
men
not
I take
but
I have known
you
that
the
love
-
of God
not
you have
in
yourselves
I
have come
in
the
name
of the
Father
of Me
and
not
you receive
Me
if
another
should come
in
the
name
the
own
him
you will receive
How
are able
you
to believe
glory
from
one another
receiving
and
the
glory
that [is]
from
the
only
God
not
you seek
Not
think
that
I
will accuse
you
to
the
Father
There is
[one]
accusing
you
Moses
in
whom
you
have hoped
If
for
you were believing
Moses
you would have believed
-
Me
concerning
for
Me
he
wrote
If
now
-
his
writings
not
you believe
how
-
My
words
will you believe
After
these things
went away
-
Jesus
over
the
Sea
-
of Galilee
-
of Tiberias
Was following
now
Him
a crowd
great
because
they were seeing
the
signs
which
He was doing
upon
those
being sick
Went up
now
on
the
mountain
Jesus
and
there
He was sitting
with
the
disciples
of Him
Was
now
near
the
Passover
the
feast
of the
Jews
Having lifted up
then
the
eyes
-
Jesus
and
having seen
that
a great
crowd
is coming
to
Him
He says
to
Philip
From where
shall we buy
bread
that
might eat
these
This
now
He was saying
testing
him
He
for
knew
what
He was about
to do
Answered
Him
-
Philip
Two hundred
denarii worth
of loaves
not
are sufficient
for them
that
each
little [piece]
one
might receive
Says
to Him
one
of
the
disciples
of Him
Andrew
the
brother
of Simon
Peter
Is
a little boy
here
who
has
five
loaves
barley
and
two
small fish
but
these
what
are
for
so many
Said
-
Jesus
Make
the
men
to recline
There was
now
grass
much
in
the
place
Reclined
therefore
the
men
the
number
about
five thousand
Took
then
the
loaves
-
Jesus
and
having given thanks
He distributed
to those
reclining
likewise
also
of
the
fish
as much as
they wished
When
now
they were filled
He says
to the
disciples
of Him
Gather together
the
having been over and above
fragments
so that
nothing
anything
may be lost
They gathered together
therefore
and
filled
twelve
hand-baskets
of fragments
from
the
five
loaves
-
barley
which
were over and above
to those
having eaten
The
therefore
people
having seen
what
He had done
[the] sign
were saying
-
This
is
truly
the
prophet
who
is coming
into
the
world
Jesus
therefore
having known
that
they are about
to come
and
to seize
Him
that
they might make [Him]
king
withdrew
again
to
the
mountain
Himself
alone
When
now
evening
it became
went down
the
disciples
of Him
to
the
sea
and
having entered
into
a boat
they were going
over
the
sea
to
Capernaum
And
dark
already
it had become
and
not
had come
to
them
-
Jesus
-
And
the sea
by a wind
strong
blowing
was agitated
Having rowed
therefore
about
stadia
twenty
five
or
thirty
they see
-
Jesus
walking
on
the
sea
and
near
the
boat
coming
and
they were frightened
-
And
He says
to them
I
am [He]
not
fear
They were willing
then
to receive
Him
into
the
boat
and
immediately
was
the
boat
at
the
land
to
which
they were going
On the
next day
the
crowd
-
standing
on the other side
of the
sea
having seen
that
boat
other
no
was
there
if
not
one
and
that
not
went with
the
disciples
of Him
-
Jesus
into
the
boat
but
alone
the
disciples
of Him
went away
but other
came
boats
from
Tiberias
near
the
place
where
they ate
the
bread
having given thanks
the
Lord
When
therefore
saw
the
crowd
that
Jesus
not
is
there
nor
the
disciples
of Him
they entered
themselves
into
the
boats
and
came
to
Capernaum
seeking
-
Jesus
And
having found
Him
on the other side
of the
sea
they said
to Him
Rabbi
when
here
have You come
Answered
them
-
Jesus
and
said
Truly
truly
I say
to you
you seek
Me
not
because
you saw
signs
but
because
you ate
of
the
loaves
and
were satisfied
Work
not [for]
the
food
that
is perishing
but [for]
the
food
-
enduring
unto
life
eternal
which
the
Son
-
of Man
to you
will give
Him
for
the
Father
has sealed
-
God
They said
therefore
to
Him
What
must we do
that
we may be doing
the
works
-
of God
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
This
is
the
work
-
of God
that
you should believe
in
Him whom
has sent
He
They said
therefore
to Him
What
then
do
You
[as a] sign
that
we may see
and
may believe
You
What
work do You perform
The
fathers
of us
the
manna
ate
in
the
wilderness
as
it is
written
Bread
from
-
heaven
He gave
them
to eat
Said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
not
Moses
has given
you
the
bread
from
-
heaven
but
the
Father
of Me
gives
you
the
bread
from
-
heaven
-
true
The
for
bread
-
of God
is
the [One]
coming down
out of
-
heaven
and
life
giving
to the
world
They said
therefore
to
Him
Sir
always
give
to us
the
bread
this
Said
to them
-
Jesus
I
am
the
bread
-
of life
the [one]
coming
to
Me
never
not
shall hunger
and
the [one]
believing
in
Me
no
not
shall thirst
at any time
But
I said
to you
that
also
you have seen
Me
and yet
not
believe
All
that
gives
Me
the
Father
to
Me
will come
and
the [one]
coming
to
Me
no
not
shall I cast
out
For
I have come down
from
-
heaven
not
that
I should do
the
will
-
of Me
but
the
will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
This
now
is
the
will
of the [One]
having sent
Me
that
all
that
He has given
Me
none
I should lose
of
it
but
will raise up
it
in
the
last
day
This
for
is
the
will
of the
Father
of Me
that
everyone
-
beholding
the
Son
and
believing
in
Him
should have
life
eternal
and
will raise up
him
I
in
the
last
day
Were grumbling
therefore
the
Jews
about
Him
because
He said
I
am
the
bread
-
having come down
from
-
heaven
And
they were saying
Not
this
is
Jesus
the
son
of Joseph
of whom
we
know
the
father
and
the
mother
How
then
says He
-
From
-
heaven
I have come down
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
Not
grumble
with
one another
No one
is able
to come
to
Me
if
not
the
Father
the [one]
having sent
Me
draws
him
and I
will raise up
him
in
the
last
day
It is
written
in
the
prophets
And
they will be
all
taught
of God
Everyone
-
having heard
from
the
Father
and
having learned
comes
to
Me
Not
that
the
Father
has seen
anyone
if
not
the [One]
being
from
-
God
He
has seen
the
Father
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
believing
has
life
eternal
I
am
the
bread
-
of life
The
fathers
of You
ate
in
the
wilderness
the
manna
and
died
This
is
the
bread
-
from
-
heaven
coming down
that
anyone
of
it
may eat
and
not
die
I
am
the
bread
-
living
-
from
-
heaven
having come down
if
anyone
shall have eaten
of
this
-
bread
he will live
to
the
age
and
the
bread
also
that
I
will give
the
flesh
of Me
is
for
the
of the
world
life
Were arguing
therefore
with
one another
the
Jews
saying
How
is able
this [man]
us
to give
the
flesh
to eat
Said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
you shall have eaten
the
flesh
of the
Son
-
of Man
and
shall have drunk
of Him
the
blood
not
you have
life
in
yourselves
The [one]
eating
of Me
the
flesh
and
drinking
of Me
the
blood
has
life
eternal
and I
will raise up
him
in the
last
day
The
for
flesh
of Me
true
is
food
and
the
blood
of Me
true
is
drink
The [one]
eating
of Me
the
flesh
and
drinking
of Me
the
blood
in
Me
abides
and I
in
him
As
sent
Me
the
living
Father
and I
live
because of
the
Father
also
the [one]
feeding on
Me
he also
will live
because of
Me
This
is
the
bread
-
from
heaven
having come down
not
as
ate
the
fathers
and
died
The [one]
eating
this
-
bread
will live
to
the
age
These things
He said
in
[the] synagogue
teaching
in
Capernaum
Many
therefore
having heard
of
the
disciples
of Him
said
Difficult
is
the
word
this
who
is able
it
to hear
Knowing
however
-
Jesus
in
Himself
that
are grumbling
about
this
the
disciples
of Him
He said
to them
This
you
does offend
What if
then
you should see
the
Son
-
of Man
ascending
where
He was
-
before
The
Spirit
it is
-
giving life
the
flesh
not
profits
nothing
The
words
that
I
speak
to you
spirit
are
and
life
they are
But
they are
of
you
some
who
not
believe
Knew
for
from
[the] beginning
-
Jesus
who
are
those
not
believing
and
who
it is
who
will betray
Him
And
He was saying
Because of
this
have I said
to you
that
no one
is able
to come
to
Me
if
not
it shall
have been granted
to him
from
the
Father
From
that [time]
many
the
disciples
of Him
departed
to
the
back
and
no longer
with
Him
walked
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
to the
Twelve
Not
also
you
are wishing
to go away
Answered
Him
Simon
Peter
Lord
to
whom
will we go
[The] words
of life
eternal
You have
and
we
have believed
and
have known
that
You
are
the
Holy One
-
of God
Answered
them
-
Jesus
Not
I
you
the
Twelve
did choose
and
of
you
one
a devil
is
He was speaking
now
-
of Judas
[son] of Simon
Iscariot
he
for
was about
to betray
Him
one
of
the
Twelve
And
after
these things
was walking
-
Jesus
in
-
Galilee
not
for
He did desire
in
-
Judea
to walk
because
were seeking
Him
the
Jews
to kill
Was
now
near
the
feast
of the
Jews
of
Booths
Said
therefore
to
Him
the
brothers
of Him
Depart
from here
and
go
into
-
Judea
so that
also
the
disciples
of You
will see
the
works
of You
that
You are doing
No one
for
anything
in
secret
does
and
seeks
himself
in
public
to be
If
these things
You do
show
Yourself
to the
world
Not even
for
the
brothers
of Him
were believing
in
Him
Says
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
The
time
-
of Me
not yet
is come
-
but
the time
-
of you
always
is
ready
Not
is able
the
world
to hate
you
Me
however
it hates
because
I
bear witness
concerning
it
that
the
works
of it
evil
are
You
go up
to
the
feast
I
not
am going up
to
the
feast
this
for
-
My
time
not yet
has been fulfilled
These things
now
having said
to them
He remained
in
-
Galilee
When
however
had gone up
the
brothers
of Him
to
the
feast
then
also
He
went up
not
openly
but
as
in
secret
The
therefore
Jews
were seeking
Him
at
the
feast
and
were saying
Where
is
He
And
murmuring
about
Him
there was
much
among
the
crowds
Some
indeed
were saying
-
Good
He is
Others
however
were saying
No
but
He deceives
the
people
No one
however
publicly
was speaking
about
Him
because of
the
fear
of the
Jews
Now
also
of the
feast
being in the middle
went up
Jesus
into
the
temple
and
was teaching
Were marveling
then
the
Jews
saying
How
this one
writings
knows
not
having studied
Answered
therefore
them
Jesus
and
said
-
My
teaching
not
is
of Myself
but
of the [One]
having sent
Me
If
anyone
desires
the
will
of Him
to do
he will know
concerning
the
teaching
whether
from
-
God
it is
or
I
from
Myself
speak
The [one]
from
himself
speaking
the
glory
the
own
seeks
the [One]
however
seeking
the
glory
of the [One]
having sent
Him
He
true
is
and
unrighteousness
in
Him
not
is
Not
Moses
has given
to you
the
law
and
no one
of
you
keeps
the
law
Why
Me
do you seek
to kill
Answered
the
crowd
A demon
You have
who
You
seeks
to kill
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
One
work
I did
and
all
you marvel
Because of
the fact that
Moses
has given
you
-
circumcision
not
that
of
-
Moses
it is
but
of
the
fathers
also
on
Sabbath
you circumcise
a man
If
circumcision
receives
a man
on
Sabbath
so that
not
might be broken
the
law
of Moses
with Me
are you angry
because
entirely
a man
sound
I made
on
the Sabbath
Not
judge
according to
appearance
but
the
righteous
judgment
judge
Were saying
therefore
some
of
those
of Jerusalem
Not
this
is he
whom
they seek
to kill
And
behold
publicly
He speaks
and
nothing
to Him
they say
not
ever
Truly
have recognized
the
rulers
that
this
is
the
Christ
But
this [man]
we know
from where
He is
The
however
Christ
whenever
He may come
no one
knows
from where
He is
Cried out
therefore
in
the
temple
teaching
-
Jesus
and
saying
Me
you know
and
you know
from where
I am
and
of
Myself
not
I have come
but
is
true
the [One]
having sent
Me
whom
you
not
know
But I
know
Him
because
from
Him
I am
and He
Me
sent
They were seeking
therefore
Him
to take
but
no one
laid
upon
Him
the
hand
because
not yet
had come
the
hour
of Him
Out of
the
crowd
now
many
believed
in
Him
and
were saying
The
Christ
When
He comes
not
more
signs
will He do
than
this [man]
has done
Heard
the
Pharisees
the
crowd
murmuring
about
Him
these things
and
sent
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
officers
that
they might seize
Him
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
Yet
time
a little
with
you
I am
and
I go
to
the [One]
having sent
Me
You will seek
Me
and
not
will find
and
where
am
I
you
not
are able
to come
Said
therefore
the
Jews
among
themselves
Where
He
is about
to go
that
we
not
will find
Him
Not
to
the
Dispersion
among the
Greeks
is He about
to go
and
to teach
the
Greeks
What
is
the
word
this
that
He said
You will seek
Me
and
not
will find
and
Where
am
I
you
not
are able
to come
In
now
the
last
day
the
great [day]
of the
feast
stood
-
Jesus
and
cried out
saying
If
anyone
thirsts
let him come
to
Me
and
drink
The [one]
believing
in
Me
as
has said
the
Scripture
Rivers
out of
the
belly
of him
will flow
of water
living
This
now
He said
concerning
the
Spirit
whom
were about
to receive
those
having believed
in
Him
not yet [given]
for
was
[the] Spirit
because
Jesus
not yet
was glorified
[Some] of
the
crowd
therefore
having heard
the
words
these
were saying
This
is
truly
the
Prophet
Others
were saying
This
is
the
Christ
Others
however
were saying
Not
indeed
out of
-
Galilee
the
Christ
comes
Not
the
Scripture
has said
that
out of
the
seed
of David
and
from
Bethlehem
the
village
where
was
David
comes
the
Christ
A division
therefore
occurred
in
the
crowd
because of
Him
Some
now
desired
of
them
to seize
Him
but
no one
laid
on
Him
the
hands
Came
therefore
the
officers
to
the
chief priests
and
Pharisees
and
said
to them
that
Because of
why
not
did you bring
Him
Answered
the
officers
Never
spoke
like this
a man
as
this
speaks
-
man
Answered
therefore
them
the
Pharisees
Not
also
you
have been deceived
Not
any
of
the
rulers
has believed
on
Him
or
of
the
Pharisees
But
the
crowd
this
-
not
knowing
the
law
accursed
are
Says
Nicodemus
to
them
the [one]
having come
to
Him
former
one
being
of
them
Not
the
law
of us
does judge
the
man
if
not
it has heard
first
from
him
and
known
what
he does
They answered
and
said
to him
Not
also
you
from
-
Galilee
are
Search
and
see
that
out of
-
Galilee
a prophet
not
is raised
And
went
each
to
the
home
of him
Jesus
however
went
to
the
Mount
-
of Olives
Early in the morning
then
again
He came
into
the
temple
and
all
the
people
were coming
to
Him
And
having sat down
He was teaching
them
Bring
now
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
to
Him
a woman
in
adultery
having been caught
and
having set
her
in
[the] midst
they say
to Him
Teacher
this
-
woman
was caught
in the very act
committing adultery
In
now
the
law
Moses
us
commanded
-
such
to be stoned
You
therefore
what
say You
This
now
they were saying
testing
Him
so that
they might have [grounds]
to accuse
Him
-
But
Jesus
down
having stooped
with
[His] finger
began writing
on
the
ground
As
however
they continued
asking
Him
having lifted Himself up
also
He said
to them
The [one]
sinless
among you
the first
-
stone
at
her
let him cast
And
again
down
having stooped
He continued to write
on
the
ground
-
And
having heard
and
by
[their]
conscience
being convicted
they began to go away
one
by
having begun
from
the
elder ones
until
the
last
and
He was left
alone
-
Jesus
and
the
woman
in
[the] midst
being
Having lifted up
then
-
Jesus
and
no one
saw
but
the
woman
said
to her
-
Woman
where
are
they
who
accuse
you
No one
you
has condemned
-
And
she said
No one
Sir
Said
then
to her
-
Jesus
Neither
I
you
do condemn
go
and
no more
sin
Again
therefore
to them
spoke
-
Jesus
saying
I
am
the
light
of the
world
the [one]
following
Me
no
not
shall walk
in
the
darkness
but
will have
the
light
-
of life
Said
therefore
to Him
the
Pharisees
You
concerning
Yourself
are bearing witness
the
testimony
of You
not
is
true
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them
Even if
I
am bearing witness
concerning
Myself
true
is
the
testimony
of Me
because
I know
from where
I came
and
where
I am going
You
however
not
know
from where
I come
or
where
I am going
You
according to
the
flesh
judge
I
not
am judging
no one
And
if
judge
however
I
-
judgment
-
My
true
is
because
alone
not
I am
but
I
and
the
having sent
Me
And
in
the
law
also
-
of you
it has been written
that
of two
men
the
testimony
true
is
I
am
the [One]
bearing witness
concerning
Myself
and
bears witness
concerning
Me
the
having sent
Me
Father
They were saying
therefore
to Him
Where
is
the
Father
of You
Answered
Jesus
Neither
Me
you know
nor
the
Father
of Me
If
Me
you had known
also
the
Father
of Me
-
you would have known
These
-
words
He spoke
in
the
treasury
teaching
in
the
temple
and
no one
seized
Him
for
not yet
had come
the
hour
of Him
He said
then
again
to them
I
am going away
and
you will seek
Me
and
in
the
sin
of you
you will die
where
I
go
you
not
are able
to come
Were saying
therefore
the
Jews
Not
will He kill
Himself
that
He says
Where
I
go
you
not
are able
to come
And
He was saying
to them
You
from
-
below
are
I
from
-
above
am
You
of
this
the
world
are
I
not
am
of
the
world
this
I said
therefore
to you
that
you will die
in
the
sins
of you
if
for
not
you believe
that
I
am [He]
you will die
in
the
sins
of you
They were saying
therefore
to Him
You
who
are
Said
to them
-
Jesus
From the
beginning
-
what
also
I am saying
to you
Many things
I have
concerning
you
to say
and
to judge
but
the [One]
having sent
Me
true
is
and I
what
I have heard
from
Him
these things
I say
to
the
world
Not
they understood
that
[about] the
Father
to them
He was speaking
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
When
you shall have lifted up
the
Son
-
of Man
then
you will know
that
I
am [He]
and
from
Myself
I do
nothing
but
as
taught
Me
the
Father
these things
I speak
And
the [One]
having sent
Me
with
Me
is
not
He has left
Me
alone
because
I
the things
pleasing
to Him
do
always
These things
of His
speaking
many
believed
in
Him
Was saying
therefore
-
Jesus
to
the
having believed
in Him
Jews
If
you
abide
in
the
word
-
My
truly
disciples
of Me
you are
And
you will know
the
truth
and
the
truth
will set free
you
They answered
unto
Him
Seed
of Abraham
we are
and
to no one
have we been under bondage
ever
How
You
say
-
Free
you will become
Answered
them
-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
everyone
-
practicing
the
sin
a slave
is
of the
sin
-
Now
the slave
not
abides
in
the
house
to
the
age
the
son
abides
to
the
age
If
therefore
the
Son
you
shall set free
indeed
free
you will be
I know
that
seed
of Abraham
you are
but
you seek
Me
to kill
because
the
word
-
of Me
not
receives a place
in
you
That which
I
have seen
with
the
Father
I speak
also
you
therefore
what
you have heard
from
the
father
you do
They answered
and
said
to Him
The
father
of us
Abraham
is
Says
to them
-
Jesus
If
children
-
of Abraham
you were
the
works
-
of Abraham
you would do
now
however
you seek
Me
to kill
a man
who
the
truth
to you
has spoken
that
I heard
from
-
God
This
Abraham
not
did
You
are doing
the
works
of the
father
of you
They said
to Him
We
of
sexual immorality
not
have been born
one
Father
we have
-
God
Said
to them
-
Jesus
If
-
God
Father
of you
were
you would have loved
-
Me
I
for
from
-
God
came forth
and
am here
not even
for
of
Myself
have I come
but
He
Me
sent
Because of
why
the
speech
-
My
not
do you understand
Because
not
you are able
to hear
the
word
-
My
You
of
the
father
the
devil
are
and
the
desires
of
father
of you
you desire
to do
He
a murderer
was
from
[the] beginning
and
in
the
truth
not
has stood
because
not
there is
truth
in
him
Whenever
he might speak
-
falsehood
from
the
own
he speaks
for
a liar
he is
and
the
father
of it
I
now
because
the
truth
speak
not
you do believe
Me
Which
of
you
convicts
me
concerning
sin
If
[the] truth
I speak
because of
why
you
not
do believe
Me
He who
is
of
-
God
the
words
-
of God
hears
because of
this
you
not
hear
because
of
-
God
not
you are
Answered
the
Jews
and
said
to Him
Not
rightly
say
we
that
a Samaritan
are
You
and
a demon
have
Answered
Jesus
I
a demon
not
have
but
I honor
the
Father
of Me
and
you
dishonor
Me
I
now
not
seek
the
glory
of Me
there is
One
seeking [it]
and
judging
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
anyone
-
My
word
keeps
death
never
not
shall he see
to
the
age
Said
to Him
the
Jews
Now
we know
that
a demon
You have
Abraham
died
and
the
prophets
and
You
say
If
anyone
the
word
of Me
keeps
never
not
shall he taste
of death
to
the
age
Not
You
greater than
are
the
father
of us
Abraham
who
died
And
the
prophets
died
Whom
yourself
make You
Answered
Jesus
If
I
glorify
Myself
the
glory
of Me
nothing
is
it is
the
Father
of Me
-
glorifying
Me
[of] whom
you
say
-
God
of us
He is
And
not
you have known
Him
I
however
know
Him
And if
I say
that
not
I know
Him
I will be
like
you
a liar
But
I know
Him
and
the
word
of Him
I keep
Abraham
the
father
of you
rejoiced
in that
he should see
-
day
-
My
and
he saw
and
rejoiced
Said
therefore
the
Jews
to
Him
Fifty
years [old]
not yet
are You
and
Abraham
You have seen
Said
to them
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
before
Abraham
was
I
am
They took up
therefore
stones
that
they might cast
at
Him
Jesus
however
hid Himself
and
went forth
out of
the
temple
And
passing by
He saw
a man
blind
from
birth
And
asked
Him
the
disciples
of Him
saying
Rabbi
who
sinned
this [man]
or
the
parents
of him
that
blind
he should be born
Answered
Jesus
Neither
this [man]
sinned
nor
the
parents
of him
but
[it was] that
should be displayed
the
works
-
of God
in
him
Us
it behooves
to work
the
works
of the [One]
having sent
Me
while
day
it is
is coming
night
when
no one
is able
to work
While
in
the
world
I shall be
[the] light
I am
of the
world
These things
having said
He spat
on [the] ground
and
made
clay
of
the
spittle
and
applied
to him
the
clay
to
the
eyes
And
He said
to him
Go
wash
in
the
pool
-
of Siloam
which
means
Sent
He went
therefore
and
washed
and
came [back]
seeing
The
therefore
neighbors
and
those
having seen
him
-
before
that
a beggar
he was
were saying
Not
this
is
he who
was sitting
and
begging
Some
were saying
-
He
it is
but others
were saying
No
but
like
him
he is
He
kept saying
-
I
am [he]
They were saying
therefore
to him
How
then
were opened
of you
the
eyes
Answered
He
The
man
-
called
Jesus
clay
made
and
anointed
of me
the
eyes
and
He said
to me
-
Go
to
-
Siloam
and
wash
Having gone
therefore
and
having washed
I received sight
And
they said
to him
Where
is
He
He says
Not
I know
They bring
him
to
the
Pharisees
who
once [was]
blind
Was
now
Sabbath
in
which
day
the
clay
had made
-
Jesus
and
opened
of him
the
eyes
Again
therefore
were asking
him
also
the
Pharisees
how
he had received sight
-
And
he said
to them
Clay
He put
of me
on
the
eyes
and
I washed
and
I see
Were saying
therefore
of
the
Pharisees
some
Not
is
this
from
God
the
man
for
the
Sabbath
not
He does keep
Others
were saying
How
is able
a man
sinful
such
signs
to do
And
division
there was
among
them
They say
therefore
to the
blind [man]
again
What
you
say
concerning
Him
for
He opened
of you
the
eyes
-
And
he said
-
A prophet
He is
Not
did believe
then
the
Jews
concerning
him
that
he had been
blind
and
had received sight
until
when
they called
the
parents
of him
-
having received sight
And
they asked
them
saying
This
is
the
son
of you
of whom
you
say
that
blind
he was born
How
then
does he see
presently
Answered
therefore
the
parents
of him
and
said
We know
that
this
is
the
son
of us
and
that
blind
he was born
How
however
presently
he sees
not
we know
or
who
opened
of him
the
eyes
we
not
know
him
ask
age
has
He
Concerning
himself
he will speak
These things
said
the
parents
of Him
because
they were afraid
of the
Jews
already
for
had agreed together
the
Jews
that
if
anyone
Him
should confess
Christ
expelled from the synagogue
he would be
Because of
this
the
parents
of him
said
-
Age
he has
him
ask
They called
therefore
the
man
out
a second time
who
had been
blind
and
said
to him
Give
glory
-
to God
We
know
that
this
-
man
a sinner
is
Answered
then
he
Whether
a sinner
He is
not
I know
One [thing]
I do know
that
blind
being
now
I see
They said
therefore
to him
What
did He
to you
How
opened He
of you
the
eyes
He answered
them
I told
you
already
and
not
you did listen
Why
again
do you wish
to hear
Not
also
you
do wish
His
disciples
to become
And
they railed at
him
and
said
You
a disciple
are
of that One
we
however
-
of Moses
are
disciples
We
know
that
to Moses
has spoken
-
God
this [man]
however
not
we know
from where
is
Answered
the
man
and
said
to them
In
this
for
-
an amazing thing
is
that
you
not
know
from where
He is
and yet
He opened
my
-
eyes
We know
that
-
God
sinners
not
does hear
but
if
anyone
God-fearing
is
and
the
will
of Him
does
him
He hears
Out of
the
age
never
it has been heard
that
opened
anyone
[the] eyes
of [one] blind
having been born
If
not
were
this [man]
from
God
not
He could
do
nothing
They answered
and
said
to him
In
sins
you
were born
entirely
and
you
teach
us
And
they cast
him
out
Heard
Jesus
that
they had cast
him
out
and
having found
him
He said
You
believe
in
the
Son
of
Man
Answered
he
and
said
And
who
is He
Lord
that
I may believe
in
Him
Said
to him
-
Jesus
Both
You have seen
Him
and
the [One]
speaking
with
you
He
is
-
And
he was saying
I believe
Lord
And
he worshiped
Him
And
said
-
Jesus
For
judgment
I
into
the
world
this
came
that
those
not
seeing
may see
and
those
seeing
blind
may become
Heard
of
the
Pharisees
these things
who
with
Him
were
and
they said
to Him
Not
also
we
blind
are
Said
to them
-
Jesus
If
blind
you were
not
-
you would have
sin
since
however
you say
-
We see
the
sin
of you
remains
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
not
entering in
by
the
door
to
the
fold
of the
sheep
but
climbing up
another way
he
a thief
is
and
a robber
The [one]
however
entering in
by
the
door
shepherd
is
of the
sheep
To him
the
doorkeeper
opens
and
the
sheep
the
voice
of him
hear
and
the
own
sheep
he calls
by
name
and
leads out
them
When
the
own
all
he has brought out
before
them
he goes
and
the
sheep
him
follow
because
they know
the
voice
of him
A stranger
however
in no way
not
they will follow
but
will flee
from
him
because
not
they recognize
-
of strangers
the
voice
This
-
allegory
spoke
to them
-
Jesus
they
however
not
knew
what
it was
that
He was saying
to them
Said
therefore
again
-
Jesus
Truly
truly
I say
to you
-
I
am
the
door
of the
sheep
All
who ever
came
before
Me
thieves
are
and
robbers
but
not
did hear
them
the
sheep
I
am
the
door
by
Me
if
anyone
enters in
he will be saved
and
he will go in
and
will go out
and
pasture
will find
The
thief
not
comes
if
not
that
he might steal
and
might kill
and
might destroy
I
came
that
life
they may have
and
abundantly
may have [it]
I
am
the
shepherd
-
good
The
shepherd
-
good
the
life
of Him
lays down
for
the
sheep
the
hired servant
however
not
being
[the] shepherd
whose
not
are
the
sheep
own
sees
the
wolf
coming
and
leaves
the
sheep
and
flees
and
the
wolf
snatches
them
and
scatters
because
a hired servant
he is
and
not
is himself concerned
to him
about
the
sheep
I
am
the
shepherd
-
good
and
I know
-
My own
and
am known
I
by
Mine
As
knows
Me
the
Father
I also
know
the
Father
and
the
life
of Me
I lay down
for
the
sheep
And
other
sheep
I have
which
not
are
of
the
fold
this
those also
it behooves
Me
to bring
and
the
voice
of Me
they will hear
and
there will be
one
flock
with one
shepherd
Because of
this
Me
the
Father
loves
because
I
lay down
the
life
of Me
that
again
I might take
it
No one
takes
it
from
Me
but
I
lay down
it
of
Myself
Authority
I have
to lay down
it
and
authority
I have
again
to take
it
This
-
commandment
I received
from
the
Father
of Me
Division
again
there was
among
the
Jews
on account of
the
words
these
Were saying
now
many
of
them
A demon
He has
and
is insane
why
Him
do you listen to
Others
were saying
These
-
sayings
not
are [those]
of one possessed by a demon
Not
a demon
is able
of [the] blind
[the] eyes
to open
Took place
at the time
the
Feast of Dedication
at
-
Jerusalem
Winter
it was
and
was walking
-
Jesus
in
the
temple
in
the
porch
-
of Solomon
Encircled
therefore
Him
the
Jews
and
they were saying
to Him
Until
when
the
soul
of us
hold You in suspense
If
You
are
the
Christ
tell
us
plainly
Answered
them
-
Jesus
I told
you
and
not
you believe
The
works
that
I
do
in
the
name
of the
Father
of Me
these
bear witness
concerning
Me
But
you
not
believe
because
not
you are
from among
the
sheep
-
of Me
The
sheep
-
of Me
the
voice
of Me
hear
and I
know
them
and
they follow
Me
and I
give
them
life
eternal
and
never
not
shall they perish
to
the
age
and
never
will seize
anyone
them
out of
the
hand
of Me
The
Father
of Me
who
has given [them]
to Me
than all
greater
is
and
no one
is able
to seize [them]
out of
the
hand
the
Father
I
and
the
Father
one
are
Took up
again
stones
the
Jews
that
they might stone
Him
Answered
them
-
Jesus
Many
works
I have shown
you
good
from
the
Father
because of
which
of these
work
Me
do you stone
Answered
Him
the
Jews
For
a good
work
not
we do stone
You
but
for
blasphemy
and
because
You
a man
being
make
yourself
God
Answered
them
-
Jesus
Not
is it
written
in
the
law
of you
-
I
said
gods
you are
If
them
he called
gods
to
whom
the
word
-
of God
came
and
not
is able
to be broken
the
Scripture
[of Him] whom
the
Father
sanctified
and
sent
into
the
world
you
do say
-
You blaspheme
because
I said
Son
-
of God
I am
If
not
I do
the
works
of the
Father
of Me
not
believe
Me
If
however
I do
even if
Me
not
you believe
the
works
believe
so that
you may know
and
may understand
that
in
Me [is]
the
Father
and I
in
the
Father
They were seeking
therefore
Him
again
to seize
but
He went forth
out of
the
hand
of them
And
He departed
again
beyond
the
Jordan
to
the
place
where
was
John
-
at first
baptizing
And
He stayed
there
And
many
came
to
Him
and
were saying
-
John
indeed
sign
did
no
everything
however
that
said
John
about
this [man]
true
was
And
many
believed
in
Him
there
Was
now
a certain [man]
ailing
Lazarus
of
Bethany
of
the
village
of Mary
and
Martha
the
sister
of her
Was
now
Mary
the [one]
having anointed
the
Lord
with fragrant oil
and
having wiped
the
feet
of Him
with the
hair
of her
whose
-
brother
Lazarus
was sick
Sent
therefore
the
sisters
to
Him
saying
Lord
behold
[he] whom
You love
is sick
Having heard
then
-
Jesus
said
This
-
sickness
not
is
unto
death
but
for
the
glory
-
of God
that
may be glorified
the
Son
-
of God
by
it
Loved
now
-
Jesus
-
Martha
and
the
sister
of her
and
-
Lazarus
When
therefore
He heard
that
he is sick
then
indeed
He remained
in
which
He was
[the] place
two
days
Then
after
this
He says
to the
disciples
Let us go
into
-
Judea
again
Say
to Him
the
disciples
Rabbi
just now
were seeking
You
to stone
the
Jews
and
again
You are going
there
Answered
Jesus
Not
twelve
hours
are there
in the
day
If
anyone
walks
in
the
day
not
he stumbles
because
the
light
the
world
of this
he sees
if
however
anyone
walks
in
the
night
he stumbles
because
the
light
not
is
in
him
These things
He said
and
after
this
He says
to them
Lazarus
the
friend
of us
has fallen asleep
but
I go
that
I may awaken
him
Said
therefore
the
disciples
of Him
Lord
if
he has fallen asleep
he will get well
Had spoken
however
-
Jesus
of
the
death
of him
they
however
thought
that
of
the
rest
-
of sleep
He speaks
Then
therefore
said
to them
-
Jesus
plainly
Lazarus
has died
And
I rejoice
for sake of
you
in order that
you might believe
that
not
I was
there
But
let us go
to
him
Said
therefore
Thomas
-
called
Didymus
to the
fellow disciples
Let go
also
us
that
we may die
with
Him
Having come
therefore
-
Jesus
found
him
four
already
days
having been
in
the
tomb
Was
now
Bethany
near
-
Jerusalem
about
away
stadia
fifteen
Many
now
of
the
Jews
had come
unto
-
Martha
and
Mary
that
they might console
them
concerning
the
brother
-
Therefore
Martha
when
she heard
that
Jesus
is coming
met
Him
Mary
however
in
the
house
was sitting
Said
then
-
Martha
to
Jesus
Lord
if
You had been
here
not
-
would have died
the
brother
of me
even
now
I know
that
whatever
-
You might ask
-
God
will give
You
-
God
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Will rise again
the
brother
of you
Says
to him
-
Martha
I know
that
he will rise again
in
the
resurrection
in
the
last
day
Said
to her
-
Jesus
I
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
the [one]
believing
in
Me
even if
he should die
he will live
and
everyone
-
living
and
believing
in
Me
never
not
shall die
to
the
age
Believe you
this
She says
to Him
Yes
Lord
I
have believed
that
You
are
the
Christ
the
Son
-
of God
the [One]
into
the
world
coming
And
these things
having said
she went away
and
called
Mary
the
sister
of her
secretly
having said
The
Teacher
is come
and
He calls
you
She
then
when
she heard
rose up
quickly
and
was coming
to
Him
Not yet
now
had come
-
Jesus
into
the
village
but
was
still
in
the
place
where
had met
Him
-
Martha
The
then
Jews
-
being
with
her
in
the
house
and
consoling
her
having seen
-
Mary
that
quickly
she rose up
and
went out
followed
her
having supposed
-
she is going
to
the
tomb
that
she might weep
there
-
Therefore
Mary
when
she came
to where
was
Jesus
having seen
Him
fell
of Him
at
the
feet
saying
to Him
Lord
if
You had been
here
not
-
of me
would have died
the
brother
Jesus
therefore
when
He saw
her
weeping
and
the
having come with
her
Jews
weeping
He was deeply moved
-
in spirit
and
troubled
Himself
And
He said
Where
have you laid
him
They say
to Him
Lord
come
and
see
Wept
-
Jesus
Were saying
therefore
the
Jews
Behold
how
He loved
him
Some
however
of
them
said
Not
was able
this [man]
-
having opened
the
eyes
of the
blind
to have caused
that
also
this one
not
should have died
Jesus
therefore
again
being deeply moved
in
Himself
comes
to
the
tomb
It was
now
a cave
and
a stone
was lying
against
it
Says
-
Jesus
Take away
the
stone
Says
to Him
the
sister
of the [one]
having died
Martha
Lord
already
he stinks
four days
for
it is
Says
to her
-
Jesus
Not
said I
to you
that
if
you should believe
you will see
the
glory
-
of God
They took away
therefore
the
stone
-
Now
Jesus
lifted
His
eyes
upwards
and
said
Father
I thank
You
that
You have heard
Me
I
and
knew
that
always
Me
You hear
but
on account of
the
crowd
-
standing around
I said [it]
that
they may believe
that
You
Me
sent
And
these things
having said
in a voice
loud
He cried out
Lazarus
come
forth
Came forth
the [one]
having been dead
being bound
the
feet
and
the
hands
with linen strips
and
the
face
of him
in a headcloth
bound about
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Unbind
him
and
allow
him
to go
Many
therefore
of
the
Jews
-
having come
to
-
Mary
and
having seen
what
He did
believed
in
Him
some
however
of
them
went
to
the
Pharisees
and
told
them
what
had done
Jesus
Gathered
therefore
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
a council
and
they were saying
What
are we to do
For
this
-
man
many
does
signs
If
we shall let him alone
Him
like this
all
will believe
in
Him
and
will come
the
Romans
and
will take away
of us
both
the
place
and
the
nation
One
however
certain
of
them
Caiaphas
high priest
being
the
year
same
said
to them
You
not
know
nothing
nor
consider you
that
it is profitable
for you
that
one
man
should die
for
the
people
and
not
all
the
nation
should perish
This
now
from
himself
not
he said
but
high priest
being
the
year
that
he prophesied
that
was about
Jesus
to die
for
the
nation
and
not
for
the
nation
only
but
that
also
the
children
-
of God
those
having been scattered
He might gather together
into
one
From
that
therefore
-
day
they took counsel together
that
they might kill
Him
-
Therefore
Jesus
no longer
publicly
walked
among
the
Jews
but
went away
from there
into
the
region
near
the
wilderness
to
Ephraim
called
a city
And there
He stayed
with
the
disciples
Was
now
near
the
Passover
of the
Jews
and
went up
many
to
Jerusalem
out of
the
region
before
the
Passover
so that
they might purify
themselves
They were seeking
therefore
-
Jesus
and
were saying
among
one another
in
the
temple
standing
What
does it seem
to you
that
no
not
He will come
to
the
feast
Had given
now
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
a command
that
if
anyone
should know
where
He is
he should show [it]
so that
they might seize
Him
-
Therefore
Jesus
before
six
days
the
Passover
came
to
Bethany
where
was
Lazarus
whom
had raised
out from
[the] dead
Jesus
They made
therefore
Him
a supper
there
and
-
Martha
was serving
-
and
Lazarus
one
was
of
those
reclining
with
Him
-
Therefore
Mary
having taken
a litra
of fragrant oil
of nard
pure
of great price
anointed
the
feet
-
of Jesus
and
wiped
with the
hair
of her
the
feet
of Him
the
now
house
was filled
with
the
fragrance
of the
oil
Says
however
Judas
-
Iscariot
one
the
disciples
of Him
-
being about
Him
to betray
Because of
why
this
-
fragrant oil
not
was sold
for three hundred
denarii
and
given
to [the] poor
He said
however
this
not
because
for
the
poor
he was caring
to him
but
because
a thief
he was
and
the
money bag
having
that
being put into [it]
he used to pilfer
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
Leave alone
her
so that
for
the
day
of the
burial
of Me
she may keep
it
the
poor
for
always
you have
with
you
Me
however
not
always
you have
Knew
therefore
-
a crowd
great
of
the
Jews
that
there
He is
and
they came
not
because of
-
Jesus
only
but
that
also
-
Lazarus
they might see
whom
He had raised
out from
[the] dead
Took counsel
however
the
chief priests
that
also
-
Lazarus
they might kill
because
many
on account of
him
were going away
of the
Jews
and
were believing
in
-
Jesus
On the
next day
the
crowd
great
-
having come
to
the
feast
having heard
that
is coming
Jesus
into
Jerusalem
took
the
branches
of the
palm trees
and
went out
to
meet
Him
and
were shouting
Hosanna
Blessed is
the [One]
coming
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
And
the
King
-
of Israel
Having found
then
-
Jesus
a young donkey
He sat
upon
it
as
it is
written
Not
fear
daughter
of Zion
Behold
the
King
of you
comes
sitting
on
a colt
of a donkey
These things
not
knew
of Him
the
disciples
from the
first
but
when
was glorified
Jesus
then
they remembered
that
these things
were
of
Him
written
and
these things
they had done
to Him
Continued to bear witness
therefore
the
crowd
-
being
with
Him
when
-
Lazarus
He called
out of
the
tomb
and
raised
him
out from
[the] dead
On account of
this
also
met
Him
the
crowd
because
they heard
this
of His
having done
the
sign
-
Therefore
the Pharisees
said
among
themselves
You see
that
not
you gain
nothing
Behold
the
world
after
Him
has gone
There were
now
Greeks
certain
among
those
coming up
that
they might worship
at
the
feast
these
therefore
came
to Philip
who was
from
Bethsaida
-
of Galilee
and
they were asking
him
saying
Sir
we desire
-
Jesus
to see
Comes
-
Philip
and
tells
-
Andrew
come
Andrew
and
Philip
and
tell
-
Jesus
-
And
Jesus
answered
them
saying
Has come
the
hour
that
should be glorified
the
Son
-
of Man
Truly
truly
I say
to you
if
not
the
grain
-
of wheat
having fallen
into
the
ground
should die
it
alone
abides
if
however
it should die
much
fruit
it bears
The [one]
loving
the
life
of him
loses
it
and
the [one]
hating
the
life
of him
in
the
world
this
to
life
eternal
will keep
it
If
Me
anyone
serves
Me
let him follow
and
where
am
I
there
also
the
servant
-
of Me
will be
If
anyone
Me
serves
will honor
him
the
Father
Now
the
soul
of Me
has been troubled
and
what
shall I say
Father
save
Me
from
the
hour
this
But
on account of
this
I came
to
the
hour
this
Father
glorify
of You
the
name
Came
therefore
a voice
from
-
heaven
Both
I have glorified [it]
and
again
I will glorify [it]
-
Therefore
the crowd
-
having stood
and
having heard
was saying
Thunder
there has been
Others
were saying
An angel
to Him
has spoken
Answered
Jesus
and
said
Not
because of
Me
the
voice
this
has come
but
because of
you
Now
[the] judgment
is
the
world
of this
now
the
prince
of the
world
this
will be cast
out
And I
if
I am lifted up
from
the
earth
all
will draw
to
Myself
This
now
He was saying
signifying
by what
death
He was about
to die
Answered
then
Him
the
crowd
We
have heard
from
the
law
that
the
Christ
abides
to
the
age
and
how
say
you
that
it behooves
to be lifted up
the
Son
-
of Man
Who
is
this
-
Son
-
of Man
Said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
Yet
a little
while
the
light
with
you
is
Walk
while
the
light
you have
so that
not
darkness
you
might overtake
And
the [one]
walking
in
the
darkness
not
knows
where
he is going
While
the
light
you have
believe
in
the
light
so that
sons
of light
you may become
These things
spoke
Jesus
and
having gone away
He was hidden
from
them
So many
however
of Him
signs
having been done
before
them
not
they believed
in
Him
so that
the
word
of Isaiah
the
prophet
might be fulfilled
that
said
Lord
who
has believed
the
report
of us
And
the
arm
of [the] Lord
to whom
has been revealed
Because of
this
not
they were able
to believe
for
again
said
Isaiah
He has blinded
of them
the
eyes
and
has hardened
of them
the
heart
that
not
they should see
with the
eyes
and
understand
with the
heart
and
turn
and
I will heal
them
These things
said
Isaiah
because
he saw
the
glory
of Him
and
spoke
concerning
Him
Nevertheless
indeed
even
of
the
rulers
many
believed
in
Him
but
on account of
the
Pharisees
not
they were confessing
so that
not
put out of the synagogue
they might be
they loved
for
the
glory
-
of men
more
than
the
glory
-
of God
Jesus
then
cried out
and
said
The [one]
believing
in
Me
not
believes
in
Me
but
in
the [One]
having sent
Me
and
the [one]
beholding
Me
beholds
the [One]
having sent
Me
I
a light
into
the
world
have come
so that
everyone
-
believing
in
Me
in
the
darkness
not
should abide
And
if
anyone
of Me
hears
the
words
and
not
keeps [them]
I
not
do judge
him
not
for
I came
that
I might judge
the
world
but
that
I might save
the
world
The [one]
rejecting
Me
and
not
receiving
the
words
of Me
has
[one]
judging
him
The
word
which
I spoke
that
will judge
him
in
the
last
day
For
I
from
Myself
not
spoke
but
the
having sent
Me
Father
Himself
Me
a commandment
gave
what
I should say
and
what
I should speak
And
I know
that
the
commandment
of Him
life
eternal
is
What
therefore
I
speak
as
has said
to Me
the
Father
so
I speak
Before
now
the
feast
of the
Passover
knowing
-
Jesus
that
had come
His
-
hour
that
He would depart
out of
the
world
this
to
the
Father
having loved
the
own
who [were]
in
the
world
to
[the] end
He loved
them
And
supper
taking place
the
devil
already
having put
into
the
heart
that
he should betray
Him
of Judas
[son] of Simon
Iscariot
knowing
that
all things
has given
Him
the
Father
into
the
hands
and
that
from
God
He came forth
and
to
-
God
He is going
He rises
from
the
supper
and
lays aside
the
garments
And
having taken
a towel
He girded
Himself
After that
He pours
water
into
the
basin
and
He began
to wash
the
feet
of the
disciples
and
to wipe [them]
with the
towel
with which
He was
girded
He comes
then
to
Simon
Peter
who says
to Him
Lord
You
of me
do wash
the
feet
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
What
I
do
you
not
know
presently
you will know
however
after
these things
Says
to Him
Peter
No
not
shall You wash
of me
the
feet
to
the
age
Answered
Jesus
him
If
not
I wash
you
not
you have
part
with
Me
Says
to Him
Simon
Peter
Lord
not
the
feet
of me
only
but
also
the
hands
and
the
head
Says
to him
Jesus
The [one]
having been bathed
not
has
need
if
not
the
feet
to wash
but
is
clean
wholly
and
you all
clean
are
but
not
all
He knew
for
the [one who]
was betraying
Him
on account of
this
He said
-
Not
all
clean
you are
When
therefore
He had washed
the
feet
of them
and
taken
the
garments
of Him
and
having reclined
again
He said
to them
Do you know
what
I have done
to you
You
call
Me
-
Teacher
and
-
Lord
and
rightly
you say
I am
for
If
therefore
I
have washed
your
-
feet
the
Lord
and
the
Teacher
also
you
ought
of one another
to wash
the
feet
A pattern
for
I gave
you
that
as
I
did
to you
also
you
should do
Truly
truly
I say
to you
not
is
a servant
greater than
the
master
of him
nor
a messenger
greater than
the [one]
having sent
him
If
these things
you know
blessed
are you
if
you do
them
Not
about
all
of you
I speak
I
know
whom
I chose
but
that
the
Scripture
may be fulfilled
The [one]
eating
of Me
the
bread
lifted up
against
Me
the
heel
of him
From
this time
I am telling
you
before
-
it comes to pass
so that
you should believe
when
it comes to pass
that
I
am [He]
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
receiving
-
any
I shall send
Me
receives
the [one]
now
Me
receiving
receives
the [One]
having sent
Me
These things
having said
Jesus
was troubled
-
in spirit
and
He testified
and
said
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
Me
Began to look
upon
one another
the
disciples
being uncertain
of
whom
He is speaking
There was
reclining
one
of
the
disciples
of Him
in
the
bosom
-
of Jesus
whom
loved
-
Jesus
Motions
therefore
to him
Simon
Peter
and
he tells
him
to ask
who
is
about
whom
He is speaking
Having leaned
he
thus
on
the
breast
-
of Jesus
he says
to Him
Lord
who
is it
Answers
then
-
Jesus
He
it is
to whom
I
will dip
the
morsel
and
will give
him
Having dipped
then
the
morsel
He takes [it]
and
gives [it]
to Judas
[son] of Simon
Iscariot
And
after
the
morsel
then
entered
into
him
-
Satan
Says
therefore
to him
Jesus
What
you do
do
quickly
This
now
no one
knew
of those
reclining
to
what
He spoke
to him
Some
for
were thinking
since
the
money bag
had
Judas
that
is saying
to him
Jesus
Buy
what things
need [of]
we have
for
the
feast
or
to the
poor
that
something
he should give
Having received
therefore
the
morsel
he
went out
immediately
it was
now
night
When
therefore
he had gone out
says
Jesus
Now
has been glorified
the
Son
-
of Man
and
-
God
has been glorified
in
Him
If
-
God
is glorified
in
Him
also
-
God
will glorify
Him
in
Himself
and
immediately
will glorify
Him
Little children
yet
a little while
with
you
I am
You will seek
Me
and
as
I said
to the
Jews
-
Where
I
go
you
not
are able
to come
also
to you
I say
now
A commandment
new
I give
to you
that
you should love
one another
as
I have loved
you
so
also
you
should love
one another
By
this
will know
all
that
to Me
disciples
you are
if
love
you have
among
one another
Says
to Him
Simon
Peter
Lord
where
go You
Answered
Jesus
Where
I go
not
you are able
Me
now
to follow
you will follow
however
afterward
Says
to Him
Peter
Lord
because of
why
not
am I able
You
to follow
presently
The
life
of me
for
You
I will lay down
Answered
Jesus
The
life
of you
for
Me
will you lay down
Truly
truly
I say
to you
no
not
[the] rooster
will crow
until
that
you will deny
Me
three times
Not
let be troubled
of you
the
heart
You believe
in
-
God
also
in
Me
believe
In
the
house
of the
Father
of Me
mansions
many
there are
if
now
not
would I have told
-
you
that
I go
to prepare
a place
for you
And
if
I go
and
prepare
a place
for you
again
I am coming
and
will receive
you
to
Myself
that
where
am
I
also
you
may be
And
to the place
I
am going
you know
the
way
Says
to Him
Thomas
Lord
not
we know
where
You are going
how
can we
the
way
Says
to him
Jesus
I
am
the
way
and
the
truth
and
the
life
No one
comes
to
the
Father
if
not
by
Me
If
you had known
Me
also
the
Father
of Me
-
you would have known
from
now
you know
Him
and
have seen
Says
to Him
Philip
Lord
show
us
the
Father
and
it is enough
for us
Says
to him
-
Jesus
So long
a time
with
you
am I
and
not
you have known
Me
Philip
The [one]
having seen
Me
has seen
the
Father
how
you
say
Show
us
the
Father
Not
believe you
that
I [am]
in
the
Father
and
the
Father
in
Me
is
The
words
that
I
speak
to you
from
Myself
not
I speak
-
but
the Father
in
Me
dwelling
does
the
works
of Him
Believe
Me
that
I [am]
in
the
Father
and
the
Father
in
Me
if
but
not
because of
the
works
themselves
believe
Truly
truly
I say
to you
the [one]
believing
in
Me
the
works
that
I
do
also he
will do
and
greater
than these
he will do
because
I
to
the
Father
am going
And
-
what
ever
you might ask
in
the
name
of Me
this
will I do
so that
may be glorified
the
Father
in
the
Son
If
anything
you ask
Me
in
the
name
of Me
I
will do [it]
If
you love
Me
-
commandments
-
My
you will keep
And I
will ask
the
Father
and
another
Helper
He will give
you
that
He may be
with
you
to
the
age
the
Spirit
-
of truth
whom
the
world
not
is able
to receive
because
not
it does see
Him
nor
know
But you
know
Him
for
with
you
He abides
and
in
you
He will be
Not
I will leave
you
as orphans
I am coming
to
you
Yet
a little while
and
the
world
Me
no more
sees
you
however
see
Me
because
I
live
also
you
will live
In
that
-
day
will know
you
that
I [am]
in
the
Father
of Me
and
you
in
Me
and I
in
you
The [one]
having
the
commandments
of Me
and
keeping
them
he
is
the [one]
loving
Me
the [one]
now
loving
Me
will be loved
by
the
Father
of Me
and I
will love
him
and
will show
to him
Myself
Says
to Him
Judas
not
-
Iscariot
Lord
then
what
has occurred
that
to us
You are about
to manifest
Yourself
and
not
to the
world
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him
If
anyone
loves
Me
the
word
of Me
he will keep
and
the
Father
of Me
will love
him
and
to
him
we will come
and
a home
with
him
will make
The [one]
not
loving
Me
the
words
of Me
not
does keep
and
the
word
that
you hear
not
is
Mine
but
of the
having sent
Me
Father
These things
I have said
to you
with
you
abiding
The
however
Helper
the
Spirit
-
Holy
whom
will send
the
Father
in
the
name
of Me
He
you
will teach
all things
and
will bring to remembrance
of you
all things
that
have said
to you
I
Peace
I leave
with you
peace
-
My
I give
to you
not
as
the
world
gives
I
give
to you
Not
let be troubled
of you
the
heart
nor
let it fear
You heard
that
I
said
to you
I am going away
and
I am coming
to
you
If
you loved
Me
you would have rejoiced
-
that
I am going
to
the
Father
because
the
Father
greater than
I
is
And
now
I have told
you
before
it comes to pass
that
when
it shall have come to pass
you might believe
No longer
much
I will speak
with
you
comes
for
the
of this
world
ruler
and
in
Me
not
he has
nothing
but
that
may know
the
world
that
I love
the
Father
and
as
has commanded
Me
the
Father
thus
I do
Rise up
let us go
from here
I
am
the
vine
-
true
and
the
Father
of Me
the
vinedresser
is
Every
branch
in
Me
not
bearing
fruit
He takes away
it
and
every one
-
fruit
bearing
He prunes
it
that
fruit
more
it may bear
Already
you
clean
are
by reason of
the
word
that
I have spoken
to you
Abide
in
Me
and I
in
you
As
the
branch
not
is able
fruit
to bear
of
itself
if
not
it abide
in
the
vine
so
neither [can]
you
if
not
in
Me
you abide
I
am
the
vine
you [are]
the
branches
The [one]
abiding
in
Me
and I
in
him
he
bears
fruit
much
For
apart from
Me
not
you are able
to do
nothing
If
not
anyone
abide
in
Me
he is thrown
out
like
the
branch
and
is dried up
and
they gather
them
and
into
the
fire
cast
and
it is burned
If
you abide
in
Me
and
the
words
of Me
in
you
abide
whatever
if
you wish
you shall ask
and
it will come to pass
to you
In
this
is glorified
the
Father
of Me
that
fruit
much
you should bear
and
you shall be
to Me
disciples
As
has loved
Me
the
Father
I also
you
have loved
Abide
in
the
love
-
of Me
If
the
commandments
of Me
you keep
you will abide
in
the
love
of Me
as
I
the
Father
of Me
the
commandments
have kept
and
I abide
of Him
in
the
love
These things
I have spoken
to you
that
-
joy
-
My
in
you
may be
and
the
joy
of you
may be full
This
is
-
commandment
-
My
that
you love
one another
as
I loved
you
Greater
than this
love
no one
has
that
one
the
life
of him
should lay down
for
the
friends
of him
You
friends
of Me
are
if
you do
what
I
command
you
No longer
I call
you
servants
for
the
servant
not
knows
what
is doing
his
-
master
You
however
I have called
friends
because
all things
that
I heard
from
the
Father
of Me
I have made known
to you
Not
you
Me
chose
but
I
chose
you
and
appointed
you
that
you
should go
and
fruit
you should bear
and
the
fruit
of you
should remain
so that
-
what
ever
you might ask
the
Father
in
the
name
of Me
He may give
you
These things
I command
you
that
you love
one another
If
the
world
you
hates
you know
that
Me
before
you
it has hated
If
of
the
world
you were
the
world
-
[as] its
own
would love [you]
because
however
of
the
world
not
you are
but
I
chose
you
out of
the
world
on account of
this
hates
you
the
world
Remember
the
word
that
I
said
to you
Not
is
a servant
greater than
the
master
of him
If
Me
they persecuted
also
you
they will persecute
if
the
word
of Me
they kept
also
-
yours
they will keep
But
these things
all
they will do
against
you
on account of
the
name
of Me
because
not
they have known
the [One]
having sent
Me
If
not
I had come
and
spoken
to them
sin
not
they would have had
now
however
excuse
not
they have
for
the
sin
of them
The [one]
Me
hating
also
the
Father
of Me
hates
If
the
works
not
I had done
among
them
that
no
other
has done
sin
not
they would have had
now
however
both
they have seen
and
have hated
both
Me
and
the
Father
of Me
But [this is]
that
may be fulfilled
the
word
-
in
the
law
of them
having been written
-
They hated
Me
without cause
When
comes
the
Helper
whom
I
will send
to you
from
the
Father
the
Spirit
-
of truth
who
from
the
Father
goes forth
He
will bear witness
concerning
Me
Also
you
now
bear witness
because
from
[the] beginning
with
Me
you are
These things
I have spoken
to you
that
not
you might fall away
Out of the synagogues
they will put
you
but
is coming
an hour
that
everyone
-
having killed
you
will think
[it is] a service
to offer
-
to God
And
these things
they will do
because
not
they know
the
Father
nor
Me
But
these things
I have said
to you
so that
when
might have come
the
hour
of them
you may remember
them
that
I
said [them]
to you
These things
now
to you
from
[the] beginning
not
I said
because
with
you
I was
Now
however
I go
to
the [One]
having sent
Me
and
none
of
you
asks
Me
Where
are You going
But
because
these things
I have said
to you
-
sorrow
has filled
your
-
heart
But
I
the
truth
say
to you
it is profitable
for you
that
I
should go away
If
for
not
I go away
the
Helper
no
not at all
will come
to
you
if
however
I go
I will send
Him
to
you
And
having come
He
will convict
the
world
concerning
sin
and
concerning
righteousness
and
concerning
judgment
concerning
sin
indeed
because
not
do they believe
in
Me
concerning
righteousness
now
because
to
the
Father
I go away
and
no more
you behold
Me
concerning
now
judgment
because
the
ruler
of the
world
this
has been judged
Yet
many things
I have
to you
to say
but
not
you are able
to bear them
now
When
however
shall come
He
the
Spirit
-
of truth
He will guide
you
into
the
truth
all
not
for
He will speak
from
Himself
but
whatever
He may hear
He will speak
and
the things
coming
He will declare
to you
He
Me
will glorify
for
from
that which [is]
Mine
He will take
and
will disclose
to you
All things
whatever
has
the
Father
Mine
are
because of
this
I said
that
from
that which [is]
Mine
He will take
and
will disclose
to you
A little [while]
and
no longer
you do behold
Me
and
again
a little [while]
and
you will see
Me
Said
therefore
[some] of
the
disciples
of him
to
one another
What
is
this
that
He says
to us
A little [while]
and
not
you do behold
Me
and
again
a little [while]
and
you will see
Me
and
Because
I am going
to
the
Father
They were saying
therefore
This
what
is
that
He says
a
little [while]
Not
we do know
what
He is saying
Knew
Jesus
that
they were desiring
Him
to ask
and
He said
to them
Concerning
this
do you inquire
among
one another
that
I said
A little [while]
and
not
you do behold
Me
and
again
a little [while]
and
you will see
Me
Truly
truly
I say
to you
that
will weep
and
will lament
you
-
but
the world
will rejoice
You
will be grieved
but
the
grief
of you
to
joy
will turn
The
woman
when
she is giving birth
pain
has
because
has come
the
hour
of her
when
however
she brings forth
the
child
no longer
she remembers
the
tribulation
on account of
the
joy
that
has been born
a man
into
the
world
Also
you
therefore
now
indeed
grief
have
again
however
I will see
you
and
will rejoice
your
-
heart
and
the
joy
of you
no one
will take
from
you
And
in
that
-
day
of Me
not
you will ask
nothing
Truly
truly
I say
to you
-
whatever
you may ask
the
Father
He will give
you
in
the
name
of Me
Until
now
not
you have asked
nothing
in
the
name
of Me
Ask
and
you will receive
that
the
joy
of you
may be
full
These things
in
allegories
I have spoken
to you
is coming
an hour
when
no more
in
allegories
I will speak
to you
but
plainly
concerning
the
Father
I will report
to you
In
that
-
day
in
the
name
of Me
you will ask
and
not
I say
to you
that
I
will implore
the
Father
for
you
Himself
for
the
Father
loves
you
because
you
Me
have loved
and
have believed
that
I
from
-
God
came forth
I came forth
from
the
Father
and
have come
into
the
world
again
I leave
the
world
and
go
to
the
Father
Say
the
disciples
of Him
Behold
now
in
openness
You speak
and
allegory
not
speak
Now
we know
that
You know
all things
and
not
need
have
that
anyone
You
should ask
In
this
we believe
that
from
God
You came forth
Answered
them
Jesus
Now
do you believe
Behold
is coming
an hour
and
has come
when
you will be scattered
each
to
the
own
and I
alone
you shall leave
yet
not
I am
alone
for
the
Father
with
Me
is
These things
I have spoken
to you
so that
in
Me
peace
you may have
In
the
world
tribulation
you have
But
take courage
I
have overcome
the
world
These things
spoke
Jesus
and
having lifted up
the
eyes
of Him
to
-
heaven
He said
Father
has come
the
hour
glorify
Your
-
Son
that
the
Son
may glorify
You
As
You gave
Him
authority
over all
flesh
so that
all
whom
You have given
Him
He may give
to them
life
eternal
This
now
is
-
eternal
life
that
they may know
You
the
only
true
God
and
whom
You have sent
Jesus
Christ
I
You
glorified
on
the
earth
the
work
having completed
that
You have given
Me
that
I should do
And
now
glorify
Me
You
Father
with
Yourself
with the
glory
that
I had
before
-
the
world
existed
with
You
I revealed
Your
-
name
to the
men
whom
You have given
Me
out of
the
world
Yours
they were
and to Me
them
You gave
and
the
word
of You
they have kept
Now
they have known
that
all things
whatever
You have given
Me
of
You
are
for
the
words
that
You have given
Me
I have given
them
and
they
received [them]
and
knew
truly
that
from
You
I came forth
and
they believed
that
You
Me
sent
I
concerning
them
am praying
Not
concerning
the
world
do I pray
but
concerning
those whom
You have given
Me
for
Yours
they are
And
things
of mine
all
Yours
are
and
-
Yours
Mine
and
I have been glorified
in
them
And
no longer
I am
in
the
world
and yet
themselves
in
the
world
they are
and I
to
You
am coming
Father
Holy
keep
them
in
the
name
of You
which
You have given
Me
that
they may be
one
as
we [are]
When
I was
with
them
I
was keeping
them
in
the
name
of You
which
You have given
Me
And
I guarded [them]
and
none
of
them
has perished
if
not
the
son
-
of destruction
that
the
Scripture
might be fulfilled
Now
however
to
You
I am coming
and
these things
I speak
in
the
world
so that
they may have
-
joy
-
My
fulfilled
within
them
I
have given
them
the
word
of You
and
the
world
hated
them
because
not
they are
of
the
world
even as
I
not
am
of
the
world
Not
I do ask
that
You should take
them
out of
the
world
but
that
You should keep
them
from
-
evil
Of
the
world
not
they are
as
I
not
am
of
the
world
Sanctify
them
by
the
truth
the
word
-
of You
truth
is
As
Me
You sent
into
the
world
I also
sent
them
into
the
world
and
for
them
I
sanctify
Myself
that
may be
also
they
sanctified
in
truth
Not
for
these
however
do I ask
only
but
also
for
those
believing
through
the
word
of them
in
Me
that
all
one
may be
as
You
Father
[are] in
Me
and I
in
You
that
also
they
in
Us
may be
that
the
world
may believe
that
You
Me
sent
And I
the
glory
which
You have given
Me
have given
them
so that
they may be
one
as
We
[are] one
I
in
them
and
You
in
Me
that
they may be
perfected
in
unity
so that
may know
the
world
that
You
Me
sent
and
loved
them
even as
Me
You loved
Father
[those] whom
You have given
Me
I desire
that
where
am
I
they also
may be
with
Me
that
they may behold
-
glory
-
My
that
You gave
Me
because
You loved
Me
before
[the] foundation
of [the] world
Father
righteous
although
the
world
You
not
has known
I
now
You
have known
and
these
have known
that
You
Me
sent
And
I made known
to them
the
name
of You
and
will make [it] known
so that
the
love
with which
You loved
Me
in
them
may be
and I
in
them
These things
having said
Jesus
went out
with
the
disciples
of Him
beyond
the
winter stream
-
of Kidron
where
there was
a garden
into
which
entered
He
and
the
disciples
of Him
Knew
now
also
Judas
who
was delivering up
Him
the
place
because
often
gathered together
Jesus
there
with
the
disciples
of Him
-
Therefore
Judas
having procured
the
cohort
and
from
the
chief priests
and
from
the
Pharisees
officers
comes
there
with
lanterns
and
torches
and
weapons
Jesus
therefore
knowing
all things
that
are coming
upon
Him
having gone forth
also
said
to them
Whom
seek you
They answered
Him
Jesus
of
Nazareth
He says
to them
I
am [He]
Had been standing
now
also
Judas
who
is delivering up
Him
with
them
When
therefore
He said
to them
I
am [He]
they drew
toward
the
back
and
fell
to [the] ground
Again
therefore
He questioned
them
Whom
seek you
-
And
they said
Jesus
of
Nazareth
Answered
Jesus
I have told
you
that
I
am [He]
If
therefore
Me
you seek
Allow
these
to go away
so that
might be fulfilled
the
word
that
He had spoken
-
Those whom
You have given
Me
not
I lost
of
them
not one
Simon
then
Peter
having
a sword
drew
it
and
struck
the
of the
high priest
servant
and
cut off
of him
the
ear
-
right
Was
now
name
of the
servant
Malchus
Said
therefore
-
Jesus
-
to Peter
Put
the
sword
into
the
sheath
The
cup
which
has given
Me
the
Father
no
not
shall I drink
it
-
Then
the cohort
and
the
commander
and
the
officers
of the
Jews
took hold of
-
Jesus
and
bound
Him
and
they led [Him] away
to
Annas
first
he was
for
father-in-law
-
of Caiaphas
who
was
high priest
the
year
same
Was
now
Caiaphas
the [one]
having given counsel
to the
Jews
that
it is profitable
for one
man
to perish
for
the
people
Were following
now
-
Jesus
Simon
Peter
and
the other
disciple
Since
now
disciple
that
was
known
to the
high priest
also
he entered with
-
Jesus
into
the
court
of the
high priest
-
But
Peter
stood
at
the
door
outside
Went out
therefore
the
disciple
-
other
who was
known
to the
high priest
and
spoke
to the
doorkeeper
and
brought in
-
Peter
Says
therefore
-
to Peter
the
servant girl
the
doorkeeper
Not
also
you
of
the
disciples
are
of the
man
this
Says
he
Not
I am
Were standing
now
the
servants
and
the
officers
a fire of coals
having made
for
cold
it was
and
they were warming themselves
Was
now
also
-
Peter
with
them
standing
and
warming himself
-
Then
the high priest
questioned
-
Jesus
concerning
the
disciples
of Him
and
concerning
the
teaching
of Him
Answered
him
Jesus
I
openly
have spoken
to the
world
I
always
taught
in
[the] synagogue
and
in
the
temple
where
all
the
Jews
come together
and
in
secret
I spoke
nothing
Why
Me
do you question
Question
those
having heard
what
I spoke
to them
behold
they
know
what
said
I
These things
now
of Him
having said
one
standing by
of the
officers
gave
a blow with the palm
-
to Jesus
having said
Thus
answer You
the
high priest
Answered
him
Jesus
If
evil
I spoke
bear witness
concerning
the
evil
if
however
rightly
why
Me
strike you
Sent
then
Him
-
Annas
bound
to
Caiaphas
the
high priest
Was
now
Simon
Peter
standing
and
warming himself
They said
therefore
to him
Not
also
you
of
the
disciples
of Him
are
Denied
he
and
said
Not
I am
Says
one
of
the
servants
of the
high priest
kinsman
being [of him]
of whom
had cut off
Peter
the
ear
Not
I
you
saw
in
the
garden
with
Him
Again
then
denied
Peter
and
immediately
a rooster
crowed
They are leading
then
-
Jesus
from
-
Caiaphas
into
the
Praetorium
It was
now
early
and
they
not
entered
into
the
Praetorium
so that
not
they should be defiled
but
might eat
the
Passover
Went
therefore
-
Pilate
out
to
them
and
said
What
accusation
bring you
the
man
this
They answered
and
said
to him
If
not
were
He
evil
doing
not
-
to you
we would have delivered
Him
Said
therefore
to them
-
Pilate
Take
Him
yourselves
and
according to
the
law
of you
judge
Him
Said
to him
the
Jews
To us
not
it is permitted
to put to death
no one
that
the
word
-
of Jesus
might be fulfilled
which
He had spoken
signifying
what
death
He was about
to die
Entered
therefore
again
into
the
Praetorium
-
Pilate
and
he called
-
Jesus
and
said
to Him
You
are
the
King
of the
Jews
Answered
Jesus
Of
yourself
you
this
say
or
others
did say [it]
to you
concerning
Me
Answered
-
Pilate
Not
I
a Jew
am
The
nation
-
of You
and
the
chief priests
delivered
You
to me
What
have You done
Answered
Jesus
The
kingdom
-
My
not
is
of
the
world
this
if
of
the
world
this
were
-
kingdom
-
My
-
attendants
-
-
My
would fight
that
not
I might be betrayed
to the
Jews
Now
however
-
kingdom
-
My
not
is
from here
Said
therefore
to Him
-
Pilate
Then
a king
are
You
Answered
-
Jesus
You
say
that
a king
I am
I
for
this
have been born
and
for
this
I have come
into
the
world
that
I may bear witness
to the
truth
Everyone
-
being
of
the
truth
hears
of Me
the
voice
Says
to Him
-
Pilate
What
is
truth
And
this
having said
again
he went out
to
the
Jews
and
says
to them
I
no
find
in
Him
guilt
It is
however
a custom
with you
that
one
I should release
to you
at
the
Passover
wish you
therefore
I should release
to you
the
King
of the
Jews
They cried out
then
again
saying
Not
this one
but
-
Barabbas
Was
now
-
Barabbas
an insurrectionist
At that time
therefore
took
-
Pilate
-
Jesus
and
flogged [Him]
And
the
soldiers
having twisted together
a crown
of
thorns
put [it] on
of Him
the
head
and
a robe
purple
cast around
Him
and
they began coming up
to
Him
and
saying
Hail
-
King
of the
Jews
And
they kept giving
Him
blows with the palm
And
went forth
again
outside
-
Pilate
and
he says
to them
Behold
I bring
to you
Him
out
so that
you may know
that
no
guilt
I find
in
Him
Went forth
therefore
-
Jesus
outside
wearing
the
thorny
crown
and
the
purple
robe
And
he says
to them
Behold
the
man
When
therefore
saw
Him
the
chief priests
and
the
officers
they cried out
saying
Crucify
Crucify
Says
to them
-
Pilate
Take
Him
yourselves
and
crucify [Him]
I
for
no
find
in
Him
guilt
Answered
him
the
Jews
We
a law
have
and
according to
the
law
He ought
to die
because
[the] Son
of God
Himself
He made
When
therefore
heard
-
Pilate
this
-
word
[the] more
he was afraid
And
he went
into
the
Praetorium
again
and
he says
-
to Jesus
From where
are
You
-
But
Jesus
an answer
not
did give
him
Says
therefore
to Him
-
Pilate
To me
not
speak You
Not
know You
that
authority
I have
to release
You
and
authority
I have
to crucify
You
Answered
Jesus
Not
you would have
authority
also
Me
against
if
not
it were
given
to you
from above
Because of
this
the [one]
having delivered up
Me
to you
greater
sin
has
Out of
this
-
Pilate
was seeking
to release
Him
-
but
the Jews
cried out
saying
If
this [man]
you release
not
you are
a friend
-
of Caesar
Everyone
-
a king
himself
making
speaks against
-
Caesar
-
Therefore
Pilate
having heard
the
words
these
brought
out
-
Jesus
and
sat down
upon
[the] judgment seat
at
a place
called
[the] Stone Pavement
in Hebrew
now
Gabbatha
It was
now
the Day of Preparation
of the
Passover
[the] hour
was
about
the sixth
And
he says
to the
Jews
Behold
the
king
of you
They cried out
therefore
With Him
away
away
Crucify
Him
Says
to them
-
Pilate
The
King
of you
shall I crucify
Answered
the
chief priests
Not
we have
a king
if
not
Caesar
Then
therefore
he delivered
Him
to them
that
He might be crucified
They took
therefore
-
Jesus
And
bearing
[His] own
-
cross
He went out
to
the
called
of the Skull
Place
which
is called
in Hebrew
Golgotha
where
Him
they crucified
and
with
Him
others
two
on this side
and
on that side
in between
now
-
Jesus
Wrote
then
also
a title
-
Pilate
and
put [it]
on
the
cross
It was
now
written
Jesus
of
Nazareth
the
King
of the
Jews
This
therefore
the
title
many
read
of the
Jews
for
near
was
the
place
the
city
where
was crucified
-
Jesus
and
it was
written
in Hebrew
in Latin
in Greek
Were saying
therefore
-
to Pilate
the
chief priests
of the
Jews
Not
write
The
King
of the
Jews
but
that
He
said
King
I am
of the
Jews
Answered
-
Pilate
What
I have written
I have written
The
then
soldiers
when
they crucified
-
Jesus
took
the
garments
of Him
and
made
four
parts
to each
soldier
a part
and also
the
tunic
Was
now
the
tunic
seamless
from
the
top
woven
throughout
all
They said
therefore
to
one another
Not
let us tear up
it
but
let us cast lots
for
it
whose
it will be
that
the
Scripture
might be fulfilled
They divided
the
garments
of Me
among them
and
for
the
clothing
of Me
they cast
a lot
The
indeed
therefore
soldiers
these things
did
Had been standing
now
by
the
cross
-
of Jesus
the
mother
of Him
and
the
sister
of the
mother
of Him
Mary
the [wife]
-
of Clopas
and
Mary
-
Magdalene
Jesus
therefore
having seen
[His]
mother
and
the
disciple
standing by
whom
He loved
says
to
[His] mother
Woman
behold
the
son
of you
Then
He says
to the
disciple
Behold
the
mother
of you
And
from
that
-
hour
took
the
disciple
her
to
the
own
After
this
knowing
-
Jesus
that
now
all things
had been accomplished
so that
might be fulfilled
the
Scripture
He says
I thirst
A vessel
had been set [there]
of sour wine
full
a sponge
therefore
filled
with
sour wine
a stalk of hyssop
having put on
they brought
it
to the
mouth
When
therefore
took
the
sour wine
-
Jesus
He said
It has been finished
And
having bowed
the
head
He yielded up
the
spirit
-
Therefore
the Jews
because
[the] Preparation
it was
so that
not
would remain
on
the
cross
the
bodies
on
the
Sabbath
was
for
a high
-
day
that
-
Sabbath
asked
-
Pilate
that
might be broken
their
-
legs
and
they might be taken away
Came
therefore
the
soldiers
and
of the
indeed
first
broke
the
legs
and
of the
other
-
having been crucified with
Him
to
however
-
Jesus
having come
when
they saw
already
Him
having been dead
not
they did break
His
-
legs
But
one
of the
soldiers
with a spear
His
-
side
pierced
and
came out
immediately
blood
and
water
And
the [one]
having seen
has borne witness
and
true
of him
is
the
testimony
And
He
knows
that
truth
he is speaking
that
also
you
might believe
Took place
for
these things
so that
the
Scripture
might be fulfilled
Bone
not one
will be broken
of Him
And
again
another
Scripture
says
They will look
on
the [One]
they have pierced
After
then
these things
asked
-
Pilate
Joseph
from
Arimathea
being
a disciple
-
of Jesus
concealed
however
through
the
fear
of the
Jews
that
he might take away
the
body
-
of Jesus
and
gave permission
-
Pilate
He came
therefore
and
took away
the
body
of Him
Came
now
also
Nicodemus
the [one]
having come
to
Him
by night
at the
first
bearing
a mixture
of myrrh
and
aloes
about
litras
a hundred
They took
therefore
the
body
-
of Jesus
and
bound
it
in linen cloths
with
the
spices
as
[the] custom
is
among the
Jews
to prepare for burial
There was
now
in
the
place
where
He was crucified
a garden
and
in
the
garden
a tomb
new
in
which
not yet
no one
was
laid
There
therefore
on account of
the
Preparation
of the
Jews
because
near
was
the
tomb
they laid
-
Jesus
-
Now
the first [day]
of the
week
Mary
-
Magdalene
comes
early
dark
still
it being
to
the
tomb
and
she sees
the
stone
having been removed
from
the
tomb
She runs
therefore
and
comes
to
Simon
Peter
and
to
the
other
disciple
whom
loved
-
Jesus
and
she says
to them
They have taken away
the
Lord
out of
the
tomb
and
not
we know
where
they have laid
Him
Went forth
therefore
-
Peter
and
the
other
disciple
and
were coming
to
the
tomb
Were running
now
the
two
together
and
the
other
disciple
ran ahead
faster
-
than Peter
and
came
first
to
the
tomb
And
having stooped down
he sees
lying [there]
the
linen cloths
not
however
he entered
Comes
then
also
Simon
Peter
following
him
and
he entered
into
the
tomb
and
sees
the
linen cloths
lying [there]
and
the
soudarion
which
was
upon
the
head
of Him
not
with
the
linen cloths
lying
but
by itself
having been folded up
in
a
place
Then
therefore
entered
also
the
other
disciple
-
having come
first
to
the
tomb
and
he saw
and
believed
not yet
for
understood they
the
Scripture
that
it behooves
Him
out from
[the] dead
to rise
Went away
therefore
again
to
their [homes]
the
disciples
Mary
however
stood
at
the
tomb
outside
weeping
As
therefore
she was weeping
she stooped down
into
the
tomb
and
she sees
two
angels
in
white
sitting
one
at
the
head
and
one
at
the
feet
where
had lain
the
body
-
of Jesus
And
say
to her
they
Woman
why
weep you
She says
to them
Because
they have taken away
the
Lord
of me
and
not
I know
where
they have laid
Him
These things
having said
she turned
back
-
around
and
she sees
-
Jesus
standing [there]
and
not
had known
that
Jesus
it is
Says
to her
Jesus
Woman
why
do you weep
Whom
do you seek
She
thinking
that
the
gardener
He is
says
to Him
Sir
if
you
have carried off
him
tell
me
where
you have laid
Him
and I
him
will take away
Says
to her
Jesus
Mary
Having turned around
she
says
to Him
in Hebrew
Rabboni
that
is to say
Teacher
Says
to her
Jesus
Not
Me
touch
not yet
for
have I ascended
to
the
Father
go
however
to
the
brothers
of Me
and
say
to them
I am ascending
to
the
Father
of Me
and
Father
of you
and [to]
God
of Me
and
God
of you
Comes
Mary
-
Magdalene
bringing word
to the
disciples
-
I have seen
the
Lord
and [that]
these things
He had said
to her
It being
therefore
evening
the
day
same
the
first
of [the] week
and
the
doors
having been shut
where
were
the
disciples
through
the
fear
of the
Jews
came
-
Jesus
and
stood
in
the
midst
and
He says
to them
Peace
to you
And
this
having said
He showed
both
His
hands
and
His
side
to them
Rejoiced
then
the
disciples
having seen
the
Lord
Said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
again
Peace
to you
as
has sent forth
me
the
Father
I also
send
you
And
this
having said
He breathed on [them]
and
He says
to them
Receive
[the] Spirit
Holy
If
of any
you might forgive
the
sins
they are forgiven
them
If
any
you might retain
they are retained
Thomas
however
one
of
the
Twelve
the [one]
called
Didymus
not
was
with
them
when
came
Jesus
Were saying
therefore
to him
the
other
disciples
We have seen
the
Lord
-
But
he said
to them
If
not
I see
in
the
hands
of Him
the
mark
of the
nails
and
put
the
finger
of me
into
the
mark
of the
nails
and
put
of me
the
hand
into
the
side
of Him
no
not
will I believe
And
after
days
eight
again
were
inside
the
disciples
of Him
and
Thomas
with
them
Comes
-
Jesus
the
doors
having been shut
And
He stood
in
the
midst
and
said
Peace
to you
Then
He says
-
to Thomas
Bring
the
finger
of you
here
and
see
the
hands
of Me
and
bring
the
hand
of you
and
put [it]
into
the
side
of Me
and
not
be
unbelieving
but
believing
Answered
Thomas
and
said
to Him
The
Lord
of Me
and
the
God
of me
Says
to him
-
Jesus
Because
you have seen
Me
you have believed
blessed [are]
those
not
having seen
yet
having believed
Many
indeed
therefore
also
other
signs
did
-
Jesus
in the presence
of the
disciples
which
not
are
written
in
the
book
this
these
however
have been written
that
you may believe
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
the
Son
-
of God
and
that
believing
life
you may have
in
the
name
of Him
After
these things
revealed
Himself
again
Jesus
to the
disciples
at
the
sea
-
of Tiberias
He revealed [Himself]
now
in this way
They were
together
Simon
Peter
and
Thomas
-
called
Didymus
and
Nathanael
-
from
Cana
-
of Galilee
and
the [sons]
-
of Zebedee
and
others
of
the
disciples
His
two
Says
to them
Simon
Peter
I am going
to fish
They say
to him
Come
also
we
with
you
They went forth
and
went up
into
the
boat
and
during
that
-
night
they caught
nothing
Morning
now
already
having come
stood
Jesus
on
the
shore
not
however
knew
the
disciples
that
Jesus
it is
Says
therefore
to them
Jesus
Children
not
any
fish
have you
They answered
Him
No
-
And
He said
to them
Cast
to
the
right
side
of the
boat
the
net
and
you will find [some]
They cast
therefore
and
not
it
to haul in
were they able
from
the
multitude
of the
fish
Says
therefore
the
disciple
that
whom
loved
-
Jesus
-
to Peter
The
Lord
it is
Simon
therefore
Peter
having heard
that
the
Lord
it is
the
outer garment
put on
he was
for
naked
and
he cast
himself
into
the
sea
-
And
the other
disciples
in the
boat
came
not
for
were they
far
from
the
land
but
about
away
cubits
two hundred
dragging
the
net
with the
fish
When
therefore
they got out
onto
the
land
they see
a fire of coals
lying
and
fish
lying on [it]
and
bread
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Bring
[some] of
the
fish
that
you have caught
now
Went up
Simon
Peter
and
drew
the
net
to
the
land
full
of fish
large
a hundred
fifty
three
although
so many
there are
not
was torn
the
net
Says
to them
-
Jesus
Come
have breakfast
None
dared
of the
disciples
to ask
Him
You
who
are
knowing
that
the
Lord
it is
Comes
Jesus
and
takes
the
bread
and
gives [it]
to them
and
the
fish
likewise
This [is]
now
the third time
was revealed
Jesus
to the
disciples
having been raised
out from
[the] dead
When
therefore
they had dined
says
-
to Simon
Peter
-
Jesus
Simon
[son] of John
love you
Me
more
than these
He says
to Him
Yes
Lord
You
know
that
I dearly love
You
He says
to him
Feed
the
lambs
of Me
He says
to him
again
a second time
Simon
[son] of John
love you
Me
He says
to Him
Yes
Lord
You
know
that
I dearly love
You
He says
to him
Shepherd
the
sheep
of Me
He says
to him
the
third time
Simon
[son] of John
do you dearly love
Me
Was grieved
-
Peter
because
He said
to him
the
third time
Do you dearly love
Me
And
he said
to Him
Lord
all things
You
know
You
know
that
I dearly love
You
Says
to him
Jesus
Feed
the
sheep
of Me
Truly
truly
I say
to you
When
you were
younger
you dressed
yourself
and
walked
where
you desired
when
however
you shall be old
you will stretch forth
the
hands
of you
and
another
will dress
you
and
will bring [you]
where
not
you do desire
This
now
He said
signifying
by what
death
he will glorify
-
God
And
this
having said
He says
to him
Follow
Me
Having turned
-
Peter
sees
the
disciple
whom
loved
-
Jesus
following
who
also
had reclined
at
the
supper
on
the
bosom
of Him
and
said
Lord
who
is it
who
is betraying
You
Him
therefore
having seen
-
Peter
says
-
to Jesus
Lord
this man
and
what about
Says
to him
-
Jesus
If
him
I desire
to remain
until
I come
what [is it]
to
you
You
Me
follow
Went out
therefore
this
-
saying
among
the
brothers
that
the
disciple
that
not
dies
Not
said
however
to him
-
Jesus
that
not
he dies
but
If
him
I desire
to remain
until
I come
what [is it]
to
you
This
is
the
disciple
-
bearing witness
concerning
these things
and
the [one]
having written
these things
and
we know
that
true
of him
the
testimony
is
There are
now
also
other things
many
that
did
-
Jesus
which
if
they should be written
every
one
not even
itself
I suppose
the
world
to have space
for the
to be written
books
The
indeed
first
account
I composed
concerning
all the things
O
Theophilus
which
began
-
Jesus
to do
both
and
to teach
until
the
day
having given orders
to the
apostles
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
whom
He had chosen
He was taken up
to whom
also
He presented
Himself
alive
after
the
suffering
of Him
with
many
proofs
during
days
forty
being seen
by them
and
speaking
the things
concerning
the
kingdom
-
of God
And
being assembled together
He instructed
them
from
Jerusalem
not
to depart
but
to await
the
promise
of the
Father
That which
you heard
of Me
for
John
indeed
baptized
with water
you
however
with
[the] Spirit
will be baptized
Holy
not
after
many
these
days
Those
indeed
therefore
having come together
were asking
Him
saying
Lord
if
at
the
time
this
are you restoring
the
kingdom
-
to Israel
He said
to
them
Not
yours
it is
to know
times
or
seasons
which
the
Father
put in place
by
-
His own
authority
But
you will receive
power
having come
the
Holy
Spirit
upon
you
and
you will be
for Me
witnesses
in
both
Jerusalem
and
in
all
-
Judea
and
Samaria
and
to
[the] uttermost part
of the
earth
And
these things
having said
beholding
they
He was taken up
and
a cloud
hid
Him
from
the
eyes
of them
And
as
looking intently
they were
into
the
heaven
as was going
He
then
behold
men
two
stood by
them
in
apparel
white
who
also
said
Men
Galileans
why
do you stand
looking
into
-
heaven
This
-
Jesus
-
having been taken up
from
you
into
-
heaven
thus
will come
in that
manner
you beheld
Him
going
into
-
heaven
Then
they returned
to
Jerusalem
from
[the] mount
-
called
Olivet
which
is
near
Jerusalem
a Sabbath dayâs
holding
journey
And
when
they had entered
into
the
upper room
they went up
where
they were
staying
-
both
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
Andrew
Philip
and
Thomas
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
James [son]
of Alphaeus
and
Simon
the
Zealot
and
Judas [son]
of James
These
all
were
steadfastly continuing
with one accord
-
in prayer
with [the]
women
and
Mary
the
mother
-
of Jesus
and
with
the
brothers
of Him
And
in
the
days
these
having stood up
Peter
in
[the] midst
of the
brothers
he said
was
then
[the] number
of names
together
the
same
about
a hundred
twenty
Men
brothers
it was necessary for
to have been fulfilled
the
Scripture
which
spoke beforehand
the
Spirit
-
Holy
by
[the] mouth
of David
concerning
Judas
the [one]
having become
guide
to those
having arrested
Jesus
for
numbered
he was
with
us
and
was allotted
-
a share
of the
ministry
this
This [man]
indeed
then
acquired
a field
out of
[the] reward
-
of unrighteousness
and
headlong
having fallen
he burst open
in [the] middle
and
gushed out
all
the
intestines
of him
And
known
it became
to all
those
dwelling
in Jerusalem
so that
was called
the
field
that
in the
own
language
of them
Akeldama
that
is
Field
of Blood
It has been written
for
in [the]
book
of Psalms
Let become
the
homestead
of him
desolate
and
not
let there be
[one person]
dwelling
in
it
and
The
position
of him
let take
another
It behooves
therefore
the
having accompanied
us
men
during
all
[the] time
that
came in
and
went out
among
us
the
Lord
Jesus
having begun
from
the
baptism
of John
until
the
day
in which
He was taken up
from
us
a witness
of the
resurrection
of Him
with
us
to become
one
of these
And
they put forward
two
Joseph
-
called
Barsabbas
who
was called
Justus
and
Matthias
And
having prayed
they said
You
Lord
knower of the hearts
of all
show
which
You have chosen
of
these
-
two
one
to take
the
place
of the
ministry
this
and
apostleship
from
which
turned aside
Judas
to go
to
the
place
-
own
And
they gave
lots
for them
and
fell
the
lot
on
Matthias
and
he was numbered
with
the
eleven
apostles
And
during
the
arriving of
the
day
-
of Pentecost
they were
all
together
in
the
one [place]
And
came
suddenly
out of
-
heaven
a sound
like
[the] rushing
of a wind
violent
and
it filled
all
the
house
where
they were
sitting
And
there appeared
to them
dividing
tongues
as
of fire
and
sat
upon
one
each
of them
And
they were filled with
all
Spirit
Holy
and
began
to speak
in other
tongues
as
the
Spirit
was giving
to utter forth
to them
Were
now
in
Jerusalem
dwelling
Jews
men
devout
from
every
nation
of those
under
-
heaven
Having come about
now
the
sound
of this
came together
the
multitude
and
was confounded
because
was hearing
one
each
the
own
language
speaking
them
They were amazed
then
and
were marveling
saying
Not
behold
all
these
are
who
are speaking
Galileans
And
how
we
hear
each
the
own
language
of us
in
which
we were born
Parthians
and
Medes
and
Elamites
and
those
inhabiting
-
Mesopotamia
Judea
also
and
Cappadocia
Pontus
and
-
Asia
Phrygia
both
and
Pamphylia
Egypt
and
the
parts
-
of Libya
that
[are] around
Cyrene
and
those
visiting [here]
from Rome
Jews
both
and
converts
Cretans
and
Arabs
we hear
speaking
them
-
[in] our own
tongues
the
great things
-
of God
Were amazed
then
all
and
were perplexed
other
to
other
saying
What
wishes
this
to be
Others
however
mocking
were saying
-
Of new wine
full
they are
Having stood up
however
-
Peter
with
the
eleven
he lifted up
the
voice
of him
and
spoke forth
to them
Men
of Judea
and
those
inhabiting
Jerusalem
all
this
to you
known
let be
and
give heed to
the
words
of me
Not
for
as
you
suppose
these
are drunkards
it is
for
[the] hour
third
of the
day
but
this
is
that
having been spoken
by
the
prophet
Joel
And
it will be
in
the
last
days
says
-
God
I will pour out
of
the
Spirit
of Me
upon
all
flesh
and
will prophesy
the
sons
of you
and
the
daughters
of you
and
the
young men
of you
visions
will see
and
the
elders
of you
dreams
will dream
and even
upon
the
servants
of Me
and
upon
the
handmaidens
of Me
in
the
days
those
I will pour out
of
the
Spirit
of Me
and
they will prophesy
and
I will show
wonders
in
-
heaven
above
and
signs
on
the
earth
below
blood
and
fire
and
vapor
of smoke
The
sun
will be turned
into
darkness
and
the
moon
into
blood
before
coming
day
of [the] Lord
-
great
and
glorious
And
it shall be
everyone
who
if
they shall call upon
the
name
of [the] Lord
will be saved
Men
Israelites
hear
the
words
these
Jesus
of
Nazareth
a man
having been set forth
by
-
God
to
you
by miracles
and
wonders
and
signs
which
did
by
Him
-
God
in
the midst
of you
as
you yourselves
know
Him
by the
determinate
plan
and
foreknowledge
-
of God
delivered up
by
hands
lawless
having crucified
You put to death
whom
-
God
raised up
having loosed
the
agony
of
death
inasmuch as
not
it was
possible
[for] to be held
Him
by
it
David
for
says
about
Him
I foresaw
the
Lord
before
me
continually
everything
because
at [the]
right hand
of me
He is
that
not
I should be shaken
Because of
this
was glad
of me
the
heart
and
rejoiced
the
tongue
of me
and
now
also
the
flesh
of me
will dwell
in
hope
for
not
You will abandon
the
soul
of me
into
Hades
nor
will You allow
the
Holy One
of You
to see
decay
You have made known
to me
[the] paths
of life
You will fill
me
with joy
in
the
presence
of You
Men
brothers
it is permitted [me]
to speak
with
freedom
to
you
concerning
the
patriarch
David
that
both
he died
and
was buried
and
the
tomb
of him
is
among
us
unto
the
day
this
A prophet
therefore
being
and
knowing
that
with an oath
swore
to him
-
God
out of [the]
fruit
of the
loins
of him
to set
upon
the
throne
of him
Having foreseen
he spoke
concerning
the
resurrection
of the
Christ
that
neither
was He abandoned
into
Hades
nor
the
flesh
of Him
saw
decay
This
-
Jesus
has raised up
-
God
whereof
all
we
are
witnesses
To the
right hand
therefore
-
of God
having been exalted
-
and
the promise
of the
Spirit
-
Holy
having received
from
the
Father
He has poured out
this
which
you
both
are seeing
and
hearing
Not
for
David
ascended
into
the
heavens
he says
however
himself
Said
Lord
to
[the] Lord
of me
Sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I place
the
enemies
of You
a footstool
of the
feet
of You
Assuredly
therefore
let know
all
[the] house
of Israel
that
both
Lord
Him
and
Christ
has made
-
God
this
-
Jesus
whom
you
crucified
Having heard
then
they were pierced
to the
heart
they said
then
to
-
Peter
and
the
other
apostles
What
shall we do
men
brothers
Peter
then
to
them
Repent
and
be baptized
every one
of you
in
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
for the
forgiveness
of the
sins
of you
and
you will receive
the
gift
of the
Holy
Spirit
To you
for
is
the
promise
and
to the
children
of you
and
to all
those
at
a distance
as many as
-
shall call to Himself
[the] Lord
the
God
of us
Other
and
words
many
he earnestly testified
and
was exhorting
them
saying
Be saved
from
the
generation
-
perverse
this
Those
indeed
therefore
having received
the
word
of him
were baptized
and
were added
on
the
day
that
souls
about
three thousand
They were
now
steadfastly continuing
in the
teaching
of the
apostles
and
-
in fellowship
the
breaking
of the
bread
and
the
prayers
There was coming
then
upon every
soul
awe
many
and both
wonders
and
signs
through
the
apostles
were taking place
All
now
-
having believed
together
the
same
having
all things
in common
and
the
possessions
and
the
goods
they were selling
and
were dividing
them
to all
as
-
anyone
need
had
Every
day
and
steadfastly continuing
with one accord
in
the
temple
breaking
then
at each
house
bread
they were partaking
of food
with
gladness
and
sincerity
of heart
praising
-
God
and
having
favor
with
all
the
people
-
And
the Lord
kept adding
those who
were being saved
every
day
to
their
number
Peter
now
and
John
were going up
into
the
temple
at
the
hour
-
of prayer
the
ninth
And
a certain
man
lame
from
womb
of mother
of him
being
was being carried
whom
they placed
every
day
at
the
gate
of the
temple
-
called
Beautiful
-
to ask for
alms
from
those who
were going
into
the
temple
who
having seen
Peter
and
John
being about
to enter
into
the
temple
was asking
alms
to receive
Having looked intently
now
Peter
upon
him
with
-
John
he said
Look
unto
us
-
And
he began to give heed
to them
expecting
something
from
them
to receive
Said
however
Peter
Silver
and
gold
none
there is
to me
what
however
I have
this
to you
I give
In
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
of
Nazareth
walk
And
having taken
him
by the
right
hand
he raised up
him
immediately
then
were strengthened
the
feet
of him
and
the
ankles
And
leaping up
he stood
and
began walking
and
he entered
with
them
into
the
temple
walking
and
leaping
and
praising
-
God
And
saw
all
the
people
him
walking
and
praising
-
God
They recognized
then
him
that
he
was
the [one]
for
the
alms
sitting
at
the
Beautiful
Gate
of the
temple
and
they were filled
with wonder
and
amazement
at
that
having happened
to him
Is clinging
now
he
to
Peter
and
-
John
ran together
all
the
people
to
them
in
the
porch
-
called
Solomonâs
greatly amazed
Having seen [it]
however
-
Peter
answered
to
the
people
Men
Israelites
why
wonder you
at
this
Or
on us
why
you look intently
as if
by [our] own
power
or
godliness
[we] have made
-
to walk
him
The
God
of Abraham
and
of Isaac
and
Jacob
the
God
of the
fathers
of us
has glorified
the
servant
of Him
Jesus
whom
you
indeed
betrayed
and
disowned
in
[the] presence
of Pilate
having adjudged
that one
to release [Him]
You
however
the
Holy
and
Righteous One
denied
and
requested
a man
a murderer
to be granted
to you
-
and
the Author
-
of life
you killed
whom
-
God
has raised up
out from
[the] dead
whereof
we
witnesses
are
And
on
the
faith
in the
name
of Him
this [man]
whom
you see
and
know
has strengthened
the
name
of Him
and
the
faith
which [is]
through
Him
has given
to him
the
complete soundness
this
before
all
of you
And
now
brothers
I know
that
in
ignorance
you acted
as
also
the
rulers
of you
-
But
God
what
He foretold
by
[the] mouth
of all
the
prophets
[that] should suffer
the
Christ
of Him
He has fulfilled
thus
Repent
therefore
and
turn again
for
the
blotting out
of your
-
sins
so that
-
may come
times
of refreshing
from
[the] presence
of the
Lord
and
[that] He may send
the [One]
having been appointed
to you
Christ
Jesus
whom
it behooves
heaven
indeed
to receive
until
[the] times
of restoration
of all things
of which
spoke
-
God
by
[the] mouth
of
holy
from
[the] age
His
prophets
Moses
indeed
said
-
A prophet
to you
will raise up
[the] Lord
the
God
out from
the
brothers
of you
like
me
Him
You will listen to
in
all things
as many as
-
He might say
to
you
It will be [that]
now
every
soul
who
if
not
might heed
the
prophet
that
will be utterly destroyed
out from
the
people
And
all
now
the
prophets
from
Samuel
and
those
subsequently
as many as
have spoken
also
have announced
the
days
these
You
are
the
sons
of the
prophets
and
of the
covenant
that
-
God
made
with
the
fathers
of you
saying
to
Abraham
And
in
the
seed
of you
will be blessed
all
the
families
of the
earth
To you
first
having raised up
-
God
the
servant
of Him
sent
Him
blessing
you
in
-
turning away
each
from
the
wickednesses
of you
Speaking
now
of them
to
the
people
came
upon them
the
priests
and
the
captain
of the
temple
and
the
Sadducees
being distressed
because of
-
teaching
their
the
people
and
proclaiming
in
-
Jesus
the
resurrection
-
out from
[the] dead
and
they laid
on them
the
hands
and
put [them]
in
custody
until
the
next day
it was
for
evening
already
Many
however
of those
having heard
the
word
believed
and
became
number
of the
men
about
thousand
five
It came to pass
then
on
the
next day
were gathered together
their
-
rulers
and
-
elders
and
-
scribes
in
Jerusalem
and
Annas
the
high priest
and
Caiaphas
and
John
and
Alexander
and
as many as
were
of
descent
high-priestly
And
having placed
them
in
the
midst
they began to inquire
In
what
power
or
in
what
name
did
this
you
Then
Peter
having been filled
with [the] Spirit
Holy
said
to
them
Rulers
of the
people
and
elders
if
we
this day
are being examined
as to
a good work
[to the] man
ailing
by
what [means]
he
has been healed
known
let it be
to all
you
and
to all
the
people
of Israel
that
in
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
of
Nazareth
whom
you
crucified
whom
-
God
raised
out from
[the] dead
in
Him
this [man]
stands
before
you
sound
This
is
the
stone
-
having been rejected
by
you
the
builders
which
has become
into
head
of [the] corner
And
not
there is
in
other
no one
the
salvation
not
for
name
is there
another
under
-
heaven
-
having been given
among
men
by
which
it behooves
to be saved
us
Seeing
now
the
-
of Peter
boldness
and
of John
and
having understood
that
men
unschooled
they are
and
ordinary
they were astonished
They recognized
then
them
that
with
-
Jesus
they had been
-
And
the man
beholding
with
them
standing
-
having been healed
nothing
they had
to contradict
Having commanded
however
them
outside
the
Council
to go
they began to confer
with
one another
saying
What
shall we do
to the
men
these
That
truly
for
a noteworthy
sign
has come to pass
through
them
to all
those
inhabiting
Jerusalem
[is] evident
and
not
we are able
to deny [it]
But
that
not
on
further
it might spread
among
the
people
let us warn
them
no longer
to speak
in
the
name
this
to no
man
And
having called
them
they commanded [them]
at all
not
to speak
nor
to teach
in
the
name
-
of Jesus
-
But
Peter
and
John
answering
said
to
them
Whether
right
it is
before
-
God
to you
to listen
rather
than
-
God
you must judge
not
are able
for
we
what
we have seen
and
heard
not
to speak
-
And
having further threatened [them]
they let go
them
nothing
finding
the
how
they might punish
them
on account of
the
people
because
all
were glorifying
-
God
for
that
having happened
years [old]
for
was
more than
forty
the
man
on
whom
had taken place
the
sign
this
of
healing
Having been let go
now
they came
to
the
own
and
reported
how much
to
them
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
had said
-
And
having heard
with one accord
they lifted up
[their] voice
to
-
God
and
said
Sovereign Lord
You
-
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
that [is]
in
them
-
of the
father
of us
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
through [the] mouth
David
servant
of You
having spoken
-
Why
did rage
[the] Gentiles
and
peoples
did devise
vain things
Took [their] stand
the
kings
of the
earth
and
the
rulers
were gathered
together
-
themselves
against
the
Lord
and
against
the
Christ
of Him
Were gathered together
for
in
truth
in
the
city
this
against
the
holy
servant
of You
Jesus
whom
You anointed
Herod
both
and
Pontius
Pilate
with
[the] Gentiles
and
peoples
of Israel
to do
whatever
the
hand
of You
and
the
purpose
had determined beforehand
to happen
And
-
now
Lord
look
upon
the
threats
of them
and
grant
to the
servants
of You
with
boldness
all
to speak
the
word
of You
in
that
the
hand
stretch out
You
for
healing
and
signs
and
wonders
to take place
through
the
name
of the
holy
servant
of You
Jesus
And
having prayed
they
was shaken
the
place
in
which
they were
assembled
and
they were filled with
all
the
Holy
Spirit
and
were speaking
the
word
-
of God
with
boldness
-
And
the multitude
-
having believed
were [in]
heart
and
soul
one
and
not
one
anything
of that which
possessed
he
claimed
his own
to be
but
were
to them
all things
in common
And
[with] power
great
were giving
-
testimony
the
apostles
of the
Lord
Jesus
of the
resurrection
grace
then
abundant
was
upon
all
them
Not even
for
in need
anyone
there was
among
them
as many as
for
owners
of lands
or
houses
were
selling [them]
were bringing
the
proceeds
of what
is sold
and
were laying [them]
at
the
feet
of the
apostles
distribution was made
then
to each
just as
-
anyone
need
had
Joseph
now
-
having been called
Barnabas
by
the
apostles
which
is
translated
Son
of encouragement
a Levite
a Cypriot
at the
birth
owns
by him
a field
having sold [it]
brought
the
money
and
laid [it]
at
the
feet
of the
apostles
A man
now
certain
Ananias
named
with
Sapphira
the
wife
of him
sold
a property
and
he kept back
from
the
proceeds
being aware of [it]
also
the
wife
and
having brought
a portion
certain
at
the
feet
of the
apostles
he laid [it]
Said
however
-
Peter
Ananias
because of
why
has filled
-
Satan
the
heart
of you
to lie to
[for] you
the
Spirit
-
Holy
and
to keep back
from
the
proceeds
of the
land
Not
remaining
to you
did it remain
And
having been sold
in
the
own
authority
it was
Why
-
did you purpose
in
the
heart
of you
the
deed
this
Not
you have lied
to men
but
-
to God
Hearing
now
-
Ananias
the
words
these
having fallen down
he breathed his last
And
came
fear
great
upon
all
those
hearing
Having arisen
then
the
younger [men]
covered
him
and
having carried [him] out
buried [him]
It came to pass
now
about
hours
three
afterward
also
the
wife
of him
not
knowing
that
having come to pass
came in
Replied
then
to
her
Peter
Tell
me
if
for so much
the
land
you sold
-
And
she said
Yes
for so much
-
But
Peter [said]
to
her
Why [is it]
that
have agreed together
you
to test
the
Spirit
of [the] Lord
Behold
the
feet
of those
having buried
the
husband
of you
[are] at
the
door
and
they will carry out
you
She fell down
then
immediately
at
the
feet
of him
and
breathed her last
Having come in
then
the
young [men]
found
her
dead
and
having carried out
they buried [her]
by
the
husband
of her
And
came
fear
great
upon
all
the
church
and
upon
all
those
hearing
these things
By
now
the
hands
of the
apostles
were happening
signs
and
wonders
many
among
the
people
And
they were
with one accord
all
in
the
Colonnade
of Solomon
of the
now
rest
no one
dared
to join
them
but
were magnifying
them
the
people
more
now
were added
believing
in the
Lord
multitudes
of men
both
and
women
so as
even
into
the
streets
to bring out
the
sick
and
to put [them]
on
cots
and
mats
that
coming
of Peter
at least
the
shadow
might envelop
some
of them
Were coming together
now
also
the
multitude
from the
surrounding
cities
Jerusalem
bringing
[the] sick
and
[those] being tormented
by
spirits
unclean
who
were healed
all
Having risen up
however
the
high priest
and
all
those
with
him
-
being
the sect
of the
Sadducees
were filled
with jealousy
and
they laid
the
hands
on
the
apostles
and
put
them
in
[the] jail
public
An angel
however
of [the] Lord
during
the night
having opened
the
doors
of the
prison
having brought out
then
them
said
Go
and
having stood
speak
in
the
temple
to the
people
all
the
words
of the
life
this
Having heard
now
they entered
at
the
dawn
into
the
temple
and
were teaching
Having come
now
the
high priest
and
those
with
him
they called together
the
Council
even
all
the
Senate
of the
sons
of Israel
and
sent
to
the
prison house
to bring
them
-
And
having come
[the] officers
not
did find
them
in
the
prison
having returned
then
they reported back
saying
-
The
prison house
we found
shut
with
all
security
and
the
guards
standing
before
the
doors
having opened [them]
however
inside
no one
we found
When
now
they heard
the
words
these
-
both
the captain
of the
temple
and
the
chief priests
were perplexed
concerning
them
what
-
might be
this
Having come
then
a certain one
reported
to them
-
Behold
the
men
whom
you put
in
the
prison
are
in
the
temple
standing
and
teaching
the
people
Then
having gone
the
captain
with
the
officers
was bringing
them
not
with
force
they were afraid of
for
the
people
lest
they might be stoned
Having brought
then
them
they set [them]
in
the
Council
And
asked
them
the
high priest
saying
by a charge
we commanded
you
not
to teach
in
the
name
this
And
behold
you have filled
-
Jerusalem
with the
teaching
of you
and
you intend
to bring
upon
us
the
blood
of the
man
this
Answering
however
Peter
and
the
apostles
said
To obey
it is necessary
God
rather
than
men
The
God
of the
fathers
of us
raised up
Jesus
whom
you
killed
having hanged [Him]
on
a tree
Him
-
God
[as] Prince
and
Savior
exalted
by the
right hand
of Him
-
to give
repentance
-
to Israel
and
forgiveness
of sins
And
we
are
witnesses
of the
things
these
and also
the
Spirit
-
Holy
whom
has given
-
God
to those
obeying
Him
-
And
having heard
they were cut [to the heart]
and
were desiring
to put to death
them
Having risen up
however
a certain [man]
in
the
Council
a Pharisee
named
Gamaliel
a teacher of the law
honored
by all
the
people
he commanded [them]
outside
for a short while
the
men
to put
He said
then
to
them
Men
Israelites
take heed
to yourselves
with
the
men
these
what
you are about
to do
Before
for
these
-
days
rose up
Theudas
affirming
to be
somebody
himself
to whom
were joined
of men
number
about
four hundred
who
was put to death
and
all
as many as
were persuaded
by him
were dispersed
and
it came
to
nothing
After
this man
rose up
Judas
the
Galilean
in
the
days
of the
registration
and
drew away
people
after
him
And he
perished
and
all
as many as
were persuaded
by him
were scattered
And
-
now
I say
to you
withdraw
from
the
men
these
and
let alone
them
for
if
be
from
men
the
plan
this
or
the
work
this
it will be overthrown
if
however
from
God
it is
not
you will be able
to overthrow
them
lest
ever
also
fighting against God
You would be found
They were persuaded
now
by him
and
having called in
the
apostles
having beaten
they commanded [them]
not
to speak
in
the
name
-
of Jesus
and
released [them]
They
indeed
therefore
departed
rejoicing
from
[the] presence
of the
Council
that
they had been counted worthy
for
the
Name
to suffer dishonor
Every
then
day
in
the
temple
and
in
house
not
they ceased
teaching
and
proclaiming the good news that
the
Christ
[is] Jesus
In
now
the
days
these
[as] are multiplying
the
disciples
there arose
a grumbling
of the
Hellenists
against
the
Hebrews
because
were being overlooked
in
the
distribution
-
daily
the
widows
of them
Having called near
then
the
Twelve
the
multitude
of the
disciples
they said
Not
desirable
it is [for]
us
having neglected
the
word
-
of God
to attend
tables
Select
therefore
brothers
men
out from
yourselves
being well attested
seven
full
of [the] Spirit
and
wisdom
whom
we will appoint
over
the
task
this
We
now
in the
prayer
and
the
ministry
of the
word
will steadfastly continue
And
was pleasing
the
statement
before
all
the
multitude
and
they chose
Stephen
a man
full
of faith
and
[of the] Spirit
holy
and
Philip
and
Prochorus
and
Nicanor
and
Timon
and
Parmenas
and
Nicolas
a convert
of Antioch
whom
they set
before
the
apostles
and
having prayed
they laid
on them
the
hands
And
the
word
-
of God
continued to increase
and
was multiplied
the
number
of the
disciples
in
Jerusalem
exceedingly
a great
then
multitude
of the
priests
were becoming obedient
to the
faith
Stephen
now
full
grace
and
power
was performing
wonders
and
signs
great
among
the
people
Arose
however
certain
of those
from
the
synagogue
-
called
Freedmen
including
Cyrenians
and
Alexandrians
and
of those
from
Cilicia
and
Asia
disputing
with
Stephen
And
not
they were able
to withstand
the
wisdom
and
the
Spirit
by whom
he was speaking
Then
they suborned
men
saying
-
We have heard
him
speaking
words
blasphemous
against
Moses
and
-
God
They stirred up
then
the
people
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
and
having come upon [him]
they seized
him
and
brought [him]
to
the
Council
They set
also
witnesses
false
saying
The
man
this
not
does stop
speaking
words
against
the
place
-
holy
and
the
law
we have heard
for
him
saying
that
Jesus
of
Nazareth
this
will destroy
the
place
this
and
will change
the
customs
that
delivered
to us
Moses
And
having looked intently
on
him
all
-
sitting
in
the
Council
saw
the
face
of him
as
[the] face
of an angel
Said
then
the
high priest
If
these things
so
are
-
And
he began to speak
Men
brothers
and
fathers
listen
The
God
-
of glory
appeared
to the
father
of us
Abraham
being
in
-
Mesopotamia
before
rather
dwelling
his
in
Haran
and
He said
to
him
Go out
from
the
country
of you
and
the
kindred
of you
and
come
into
the
land
which
-
to you
I will show
Then
having gone out
from
[the] land
of Chaldeans
he dwelt
in
Haran
And from there
after
-
died
the
father
of him
He removed
him
into
the
land
this
in
which
you
now
dwell
And
not
He did give
to him
an inheritance
in
it
not even
[the] length
of a foot
but
He promised
to give
to him
for
a possession
it
and
to the
descendants
of him
after
him
not
there being
to him
a child
Spoke
however
thus
-
God
that
will be
the
seed
of him
a sojourner
in
a land
strange
and
they will enslave
it
and
will mistreat [it]
years
four hundred
And
the
nation
to which
if
they will be in bondage
will judge
I
-
God
said
and
after
these things
they will come forth
and
will serve
Me
in
the
place
this
And
He gave
to him
[the] covenant
of circumcision
and
thus
he begat
-
Isaac
and
circumcised
him
on the
day
-
eighth
and
Isaac
-
Jacob
and
Jacob
the
twelve
patriarchs
And
the
patriarchs
having envied
-
Joseph
sold [him]
into
Egypt
But
was
-
God
with
him
and
rescued
him
out of
all
the
tribulations
of him
and
gave
him
favor
and
wisdom
before
Pharaoh
king
of Egypt
and
he appointed
him
ruler
over
Egypt
and
all
the
house
of him
Came
then
a famine
upon
all
-
of Egypt
and
Canaan
and
affliction
great
and
not
were finding
sustenance
the
fathers
of us
Having heard
now
Jacob
[there] is
grain
in
Egypt
he sent forth
the
fathers
of us
first
and
on
the
second time
was made known
Joseph
to
brothers
of him
and
known
became
-
to Pharaoh
the
family
of Joseph
Having sent
then
Joseph
he called for
Jacob
the
father
of him
and
all
the
kindred
in all
souls
seventy
five
And
went down
Jacob
into
Egypt
and
died
he
and
the
fathers
of us
and
they were carried over
into
Shechem
and
were placed
in
the
tomb
which
had bought
Abraham
for a sum
of silver
from
the
sons
of Hamor
in
Shechem
As
now
was drawing near
the
time
of the
promise
that
had made
-
God
-
to Abraham
increased
the
people
and
multiplied
in
Egypt
until
that
there arose
king
another
over
Egypt
who
not
knew
-
Joseph
He
having dealt treacherously with
the
race
of us
he mistreated
the
fathers
-
making [them]
the
infants
abandon
of them
unto
the
not
they would live
In
that
time
was born
Moses
and
he was
beautiful
-
to God
who
was brought up
months
three
in
the
house
of the
father
Having been set outside
then
he
took up
him
the
daughter
of Pharaoh
and
brought up
him
for herself
for
a son
And
was instructed
Moses
all
[the] wisdom
of [the] Egyptians
he was
now
mighty
in
words
and
deeds
of him
When
then
was fulfilled
to him
of forty years
a period
it came
into
the
mind
of him
to visit
the
brothers
of him
the
sons
of Israel
And
having seen
a certain one
being wronged
he defended [him]
and
did
vengeance
for the [one]
being oppressed
having struck down
the
Egyptian
He was supposing
now
to understand
the
brothers
that
-
God
by
[the] hand
of him
is giving
salvation
them
-
but
not
they understood
On the
and
following
day
he appeared
to those who
were quarreling
and
urged
them
to
peace
having said
Men
brothers
you are
So that
why
wrong you
one another
The [one]
however
mistreating
the
neighbor
pushed away
him
having said
Who
you
appointed
ruler
and
judge
over
us
Not
to kill
me
you
desire
the same
way
you put to death
yesterday
the
Egyptian
Fled
then
Moses
at
the
remark
this
and
became
exiled
in
[the] land
of Midian
where
he begat
sons
two
And
having been passed
years
forty
appeared
to him
in
the
wilderness
of the
Mount
Sinai
an angel
in
a flame
of fire
of a bush
-
And
Moses
having seen [it]
marveled at
the
vision
coming near
then
of him
to behold [it]
there was
[the] voice
of [the] Lord
I [am]
the
God
of the
Fathers
of you
the
God
of Abraham
and
of Isaac
and
of Jacob
Terrified
then
having become
Moses
not
he dared
to look
Said
then
to him
the
Lord
Take off
the
sandal
of the
feet
of you
-
for
the place
on
which
you stand
ground
holy
is
Having seen
I saw
the
oppression
of the
people
of Me
-
in
Egypt
and
the
groans
of them
I have heard
and
I have come down
to deliver
them
and
now
come
I will send
you
to
Egypt
This
-
Moses
whom
they rejected
having said
Who
you
appointed
ruler
and
judge
him
whom
God [as]
and
ruler
and
redeemer
sent
by
[the] hand
of [the] angel
-
having appeared
to him
in
the
bush
this one
led out
them
having done
wonders
and
signs
in
[the] land
of Egypt
and
in
[the] Red
Sea
and
in
the
wilderness
years
forty
This
is
the
Moses
-
having said
to the
sons
of Israel
A prophet
for you
will raise up
-
God
out from
the
brothers
of you
like
me
This
is
the [one]
having been
in
the
congregation
in
the
wilderness
with
the
angel
-
speaking
to him
in
the
Mount
Sinai
and
of the
fathers
of us
who
received
oracles
living
to give
to us
to whom
not
were willing
obedient
to be
the
fathers
of us
but
thrust away
and
turned back
in
the
hearts
of them
to
Egypt
having said
-
to Aaron
Make
us
gods
who
will go before
us
-
As for
Moses
this
who
brought out
us
from
[the] land
of Egypt
not
we know
what
has happened
to him
And
they made a calf
in
the
days
those
and
offered
a sacrifice
to the
idol
and
they were rejoicing
in
the
works
of the
hands
of them
Turned away
however
-
God
and
delivered
them
to worship
the
host
of
heaven
as
it has been written
in [the]
book
of the
prophets
Not
slain beasts
and
sacrifices
did you offer
to Me
years
forty
in
the
wilderness
O house
of Israel
And
You took up
the
tabernacle
-
of Moloch
and
the
star
of the
god
Rephan
the
images
that
you made
to worship
them
and
I will remove
you
beyond
Babylon
The
tabernacle
of the
testimony
was
with
fathers
of us
in
the
wilderness
just as
had commanded
the [One]
speaking
-
to Moses
to make
it
according to
the
pattern
that
he had seen
which
also
brought [it]
having received by succession
the
fathers
of us
with
Joshua
in
the
taking possession
of the
nations
whom
drove out
-
God
from [the]
face
of the
fathers
of us
until
the
days
of David
who
found
favor
before
-
God
and
asked
to find
a dwelling place
for the
God
of Jacob
Solomon
however
built
Him
[the] house
Yet
not
the
Most High
in
hand-made [houses]
dwells
As
the
prophet
says
-
Heaven [is]
to Me
a throne
-
and
the earth
a footstool
of the
feet
of Me
What kind of
house
will you build
Me
says
[the] Lord
or
what [is]
[the] place
of the
rest
of Me
Not
the
hand
of Me
has made
these things
all
Stiff-necked
and
uncircumcised
in heart
and
-
ears
you
always
the
Spirit
-
Holy
resist
as
the
fathers
of you
also
you
Which
of the
prophets
not
did persecute
the
fathers
of you
And
they killed
those
having foretold
about
the
coming
of the
Righteous One
of whom
now
you
betrayers
and
murderers
have become
who
received
the
law
by
[the] ordination
of angels
and
not
have kept [it]
Hearing
now
these things
they were cut
in the
hearts
of them
and
began gnashing
the
teeth
at
him
He being
however
full
of [the] Spirit
Holy
having looked intently
into
-
heaven
saw
[the] glory
of God
and
Jesus
standing
at
the right hand
-
of God
and
he said
Behold
I see
the
heavens
having been opened
and
the
Son
-
of Man
at
the right [hand]
standing
-
of God
Having cried out
then
in a voice
loud
they held
the
ears
of them
and
rushed
with one accord
upon
him
and
having cast [him]
out of
the
city
they began to stone [him]
And
the
witnesses
laid aside
the
garments
of them
at
the
feet
of a young man
named
Saul
And [as]
they were stoning
-
Stephen
he was calling out
and
saying
Lord
Jesus
receive
the
spirit
of me
Having fallen
then
on [his]
knees
he cried
in a voice
loud
Lord
not
place
to them
this
-
sin
And
this
having said
he fell asleep
Saul
now
was there
consenting
to the
killing
of him
Arose
then
on
that
-
day
a persecution
great
against
the
church
which [was]
in
Jerusalem
All
then
were scattered
throughout
the
regions
-
of Judea
and
Samaria
except
the
apostles
Buried
now
-
Stephen
men
devout
and
made
lamentation
great
over
him
Saul
however
was destroying
the
church
[houses] after
-
houses
entering
dragging off
then
men
and
women
he was delivering [them]
to
prison
Those
indeed
therefore
having been scattered
went about
preaching
the
word
Philip
now
having gone down
to
-
[a] city
-
of Samaria
was proclaiming
to them
the
Christ
Were giving heed
now
the
crowds
to the things
being spoken
by
-
Philip
with one accord
in
the [time]
to hear
them
and
to see
the
signs
that
he was performing
Many
for
of those
having
spirits
unclean
crying
voice
in a loud
they were coming out [of them]
many
now
having been paralyzed
and
lame
were healed
There was
then
great
joy
in
the
city
that
A man
now
certain
named
Simon
had been formerly
in
the
city
practicing sorcery
and
amazing
the
people
-
of Samaria
declaring
to be
someone
himself
great
to whom
were giving heed
all
from
small
to
great
saying
This one
is
the
power
-
of God
that
[is] called
Great
They were giving heed
now
to him
because
the
long
time
with the
magic arts
he had amazed
them
When
however
they believed
-
Philip
proclaiming the gospel
concerning
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
they were baptized
men
both
and
women
-
And
Simon
also
himself
believed
and
having been baptized
was
steadfastly continuing
-
with Philip
Beholding
then
[the] signs
and
miracles
great
being performed
he was amazed
Having heard
now
the
in
Jerusalem
apostles
that
had received
-
Samaria
the
word
-
of God
they sent
to
them
Peter
and
John
who
having come down
prayed
for
them
that
they might receive [the]
Spirit
Holy
Not yet
for
He was
upon
any
of them
fallen
only
however
baptized
they had been
into
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Then
they began laying
the
hands
upon
them
and
they received
[the] Spirit
Holy
Having seen
now
-
of Simon
that
through
the
laying on
of the
hands
of the
apostles
was given
the
Spirit
he offered
to them
money
saying
Give
also to me
the
authority
this
that
on whom
if
I may lay
the
hands
he may receive
[the] Spirit
Holy
Peter
however
said
to
him
The
silver
of you
with
you
may it be
to
destruction
because
the
gift
-
of God
you thought
by
money
to be obtained
No
there is
to you
part
nor
lot
in
the
matter
this
the
for
heart
of you
not
is
right
before
-
God
Repent
therefore
of
the
wickedness
of yours
this
and
pray earnestly to
the
Lord
if
indeed
will be forgiven
you
the
intent
of the
heart
of you
in
for
[the] gall
of bitterness
and
[the] bond
of iniquity
I see
you
being
Answering
now
-
Simon
said
Pray earnestly
you
on behalf
of me
to
the
Lord
so that
nothing
may come
upon
me
of which
you have spoken
They
indeed
therefore
having earnestly testified
and
having spoken
the
word
of the
Lord
traveled back
to
Jerusalem
to many
then
villages
of the
Samaritans
they were preaching the gospel
An angel
now
of [the] Lord
spoke
to
Philip
saying
Rise up
and
go
toward
[the] south
to
the
road
-
going down
from
Jerusalem
to
Gaza
This
is
[the] desert [road]
And
having risen up
he went
And
behold
a man
an Ethiopian
a eunuch
a potentate
of Candace
queen
of [the] Ethiopians
who
was
over
all
the
treasure
of her
who
had come
to worship
to
Jerusalem
he was
then
returning
and
sitting
in
the
chariot
of him
and
he was reading
the
prophet
Isaiah
Said
then
the
Spirit
-
to Philip
Go near
and
join yourself
to the
chariot
this
Having run up
then
-
Philip
heard
him
reading
Isaiah
the
prophet
and
said
Then
also
understand you
what
you are reading
-
And
he said
How
for
-
could I be able
if
not
someone
will guide
me
He invited
then
-
Philip
having come up
to sit
with
him
-
Now
the passage
of the
Scripture
which
he was reading
was
this
As
a sheep
to
slaughter
He was led
and
as
a lamb
before
the [one]
shearing
him
[is] silent
so
not
He opens
the
mouth
of Him
In
the
humiliation
-
justice
from Him
was taken away
The
generation
of Him
who
will describe
For
is removed
from
the
earth
the
life
of Him
Answering
now
the
eunuch
-
to Philip
said
I pray
you
concerning
whom
the
prophet
says
this
Concerning
himself
or
concerning
other
some
Having opened
then
-
Philip
the
mouth
of him
and
having begun
from
the
Scripture
this
he proclaimed the good news
to him
-
Jesus
As
then
they were going
along
the
road
they came
upon
some
water
and
says
the
eunuch
Behold
water
what
prevents
me
to be baptized
And
he commanded
to stop
the
chariot
And
they went down
both
to
the
water
-
both
Philip
and
the
eunuch
and
he baptized
him
When
now
they came up
out of
the
water
[the] Spirit
of [the] Lord
carried away
-
Philip
and
not
saw
him
no longer
the
eunuch
he went
for
the
way
of him
rejoicing
Philip
however
was found
at
Azotus
and
passing through
he was proclaiming the gospel
to the
towns
all
until
-
coming
his
to
Caesarea
-
But
Saul
still
breathing out
threats
and
murder
toward
the
disciples
of the
Lord
having gone
to the
high priest
requested
from
him
letters
in
Damascus
to
the
synagogues
so that
if
any
he found
of the
way
being
men
both
and
women
having bound
he might bring [them]
to
Jerusalem
In
now
-
proceeding
it came to pass
[as] he
draws near
-
to Damascus
suddenly
also
him
flashed around
a light
from
-
heaven
And
having fallen
on
the
ground
he heard
a voice
saying
to him
Saul
Saul
why
Me
do you persecute
He said
then
Who
are You
Lord
-
And [He said]
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are persecuting
But
rise up
and
enter
into
the
city
and
it will be told
you
that
what
you
it behooves
to do
-
And
the men
-
traveling with
him
stood
speechless
hearing
indeed
the
voice
no one
however
seeing
Rose up
then
Saul
from
the
ground
having been opened
however
the
eyes
of him
nothing
he could see
Leading by the hand
then
him
they brought [him]
to
Damascus
And
he was
days
three
without
seeing
and
neither
did he eat
nor
drink
There was
now
a certain
disciple
in
Damascus
named
Ananias
And
said
to
him
in
a vision
the
Lord
Ananias
-
And
he said
Behold
me
Lord
-
And
the Lord
to
him [said]
Having risen up
go
into
the
street
-
called
Straight
and
seek
in
[the] house
of Judas
Saul
named
of Tarsus
Behold
for
he is praying
and
he saw
a man
Ananias
named
having come
and
having put
on him
hands
so that
he might see again
Answered
but
Ananias
Lord
I have heard
from
many
concerning
the
man
this
how many
evils
to
saints
of You
he did
in
Jerusalem
and
here
he has
authority
from
the
chief priests
to bind
all
those
calling on
the
name
of You
Said
however
to
him
the
Lord
Go
for
a vessel
of choice
is
to Me
this [man]
-
to carry
the
name
of Me
before
Gentiles
and
also
kings
[the] sons
then
of Israel
I
for
will show
to him
how much
it behooves
him
for
the
name
of Me
to suffer
Went away
then
Ananias
and
entered
into
the
house
and
having laid
upon
him
the
hands
he said
Saul
Brother
the
Lord
has sent
me
Jesus
the [One]
having appeared
to you
on
the
road
by which
you were coming
that
you may see again
and
be filled
[of the] Spirit
Holy
And
immediately
fell
of him
from
the
eyes
[something] like
scales
he regained his sight
also
And
having risen up
he was baptized
and
having taken
food
he was strengthened
He was
now
with
the
in
Damascus
disciples
days
some
And
immediately
in
the
synagogues
he began proclaiming
-
Jesus
that
He
is
the
Son
-
of God
Were amazed
then
all
-
hearing
and
were saying
Not
this
is
the [one]
having ravaged
in
Jerusalem
those
calling on
the
name
this
And
here
for
this
he had come
that
having been bound
them
he might bring
to
the
chief priests
Saul
however
all the more
was empowered
and
kept confounding
Jews
-
dwelling
in
Damascus
proving
that
this
is
the
Christ
When
now
had passed
days
many
plotted together
the
Jews
to kill
him
became known
however
-
to Saul
the
plot
of them
They were closely watching
now
also
the
gates
day
and
also
night
so that
him
they might kill
having taken [him]
however
the
disciples
of him
by night
through
the
wall
they let down
him
having lowered [him]
in
a basket
Having arrived
then
in
Jerusalem
he was attempting
to join
the
disciples
And
all
were afraid of
him
not
believing
that
he is
a disciple
Barnabas
however
having taken
him
brought [him]
to
the
apostles
and
he related
to them
how
on
the
road
he had seen
the
Lord
and
that
He had spoken
to him
and
how
in
Damascus
he had spoken boldly
in
the
name
of Jesus
And
he was
with
them
coming in
and
going out
in
Jerusalem
speaking boldly
in
the
name
of
Lord
He was speaking
also
and
was debating
with
the
Hellenists
-
but
they were seeking
to kill
him
Having known [it]
however
the
brothers
brought down
him
to
Caesarea
and
sent away
him
to
Tarsus
The
indeed
then
church
throughout
all
-
of Judea
and
Galilee
and
Samaria
had
peace
being edified
and
going on
in the
fear
of the
Lord
and
in the
comfort
of the
Holy
Spirit
they were multiplied
It came to pass that
now
Peter
passing
through
all [quarters]
went down
also
to
the
saints
-
inhabiting
Lydda
He found
then
there
a man
certain
named
Aeneas
for
years
eight
lying
on
a bed
who
was
paralyzed
And
said
to him
-
Peter
Aeneas
heals
you
Jesus
Christ
rise up
and
make the bed
for yourself
And
immediately
he rose up
And
saw
him
all
those
inhabiting
Lydda
and
-
Sharon
who
turned
to
the
Lord
In
Joppa
now
certain
there was
a disciple
named
Tabitha
which
translated
is called
Dorcas
She
was
full of
works
good
and
of alms
that
she continually did
It came to pass
however
in
the
days
those
[that] having become sick
she
died
Having washed [her]
then
put [her]
in
an upper room
Near
now
being
Lydda
-
Joppa
the
disciples
having heard
that
Peter
is
in
it
sent
two
men
to
him
imploring
Not
to delay
coming
to
us
Having risen up
then
Peter
went with
them
who
having arrived
brought [him]
into
the
upper room
And
stood by
him
all
the
widows
weeping
and
showing
[the] tunics
and
garments
that
had made
with
them
being
-
Dorcas
Having put
then
outside
all
-
Peter
and
having bowed
the
knees
he prayed
And
having turned
to
the
body
he said
Tabitha
arise
-
And
she opened
the
eyes
of her
and
having seen
-
Peter
she sat up
Having given
then
her
[his] hand
he raised up
her
Having called
then
the
saints
and
the
widows
he presented
her
living
Known
then
it became
throughout
all
-
of Joppa
and
believed
many
on
the
Lord
It came to pass
then
days
many
he stayed
in
Joppa
with
a certain
Simon
a tanner
A man
now
certain
in
Caesarea
named
Cornelius
[was] a centurion
of
[the] Cohort
that
is called
Italian
devout
and
fearing
-
God
with
all
the
household
of him
doing
alms
many
to the
people
and
praying
to
God
continually
all
He saw
in
a vision
clearly
as if
about
hour
the ninth
of the
day
an angel
-
of God
having come
to
him
and
having said
to him
Cornelius
-
And
having looked intently
on him
and
afraid
having become
he said
What
is it
Lord
He said
then
to him
The
prayers
of You
and
the
alms
of you
have ascended
as
a memorial
before
-
God
And
now
send
men
to
Joppa
and
summon
Simon
a man
who
is called
Peter
He
lodges
with
a certain
Simon
a tanner
whose
is
[the] house
by
[the] sea
When
then
had departed
the
angel
-
speaking
to him
having called
two
of the
servants
and
a soldier
devout
of those who
are attending
him
and
having related
all things
to them
he sent
them
to
-
Joppa
On the
now
next day
as are journeying
these
and
the
city
approaching
went up
Peter
on
the
housetop
to pray
about
hour
the sixth
He became
then
hungry
and
desired
to eat
[as] were preparing
however
they
fell
upon
him
a trance
and
he beholds
-
heaven
opening
and
descending
a vessel
certain
as
a sheet
great
by four
corners
being let down
upon
the
earth
in
which
were
all
the
quadrupeds
and
creeping things
of the
earth
and
birds
of
heaven
And
came
a voice
to
him
Having risen up
Peter
kill
and
eat
-
And
Peter
said
In no way
Lord
for
never
have I eaten
anything
common
or
unclean
And
a voice
[came] again
for
the second time
to
him
What
-
God
has cleansed
you
not
call common
This
now
took place
for
three times
and
immediately
was taken up
the
vessel
into
-
heaven
While
then
in
himself
was perplexed
-
Peter
what
-
might be
the
vision
that
he had seen
behold
the
men
-
having been sent
from
-
Cornelius
having inquired for
the
house
-
of Simon
stood
at
the
gate
And
having called out
they were asking
if
Simon
who [is]
called
Peter
here
is lodged
-
And
of Peter
thinking
over
the
vision
said
the
Spirit
Behold
men
three
are seeking
you
But
having risen
go down
and
proceed
with
them
nothing
doubting
because
I
have sent
them
Having gone down
then
Peter
to
the
men
he said
Behold
I
am
whom
you seek
what [is]
the
cause
for
which
you are here
-
And
they said
Cornelius
a centurion
a man
righteous
and
fearing
-
God
being well testified to
then
by
all
the
nation
of the
Jews
was divinely instructed
by
an angel
holy
to send for
you
to
the
house
of him
and
to hear
a message
from
you
Having called in
therefore
them
he lodged [them]
On the
now
next day
having risen up
he went forth
with
them
and
some
of the
brothers
those
from
Joppa
went with
him
On the
now
next day
he entered
into
-
Caesarea
-
and
Cornelius
was
expecting
them
having called together
the
relatives
of him
and
-
close
friends
As
then
was
-
entering
-
Peter
having met
him
-
Cornelius
having fallen
at
the
feet
worshiped [him]
-
But
Peter
lifted up
him
saying
Rise up
also
I
myself
a man
am
And
talking with
him
he entered
and
he finds
having gathered together
many
He was saying
then
to
them
You
know
how
unlawful
it is
for a man
a Jew
to unite himself
or
to come near
to a foreigner
To me
however
God
has shown
not
common
or
unclean
to call
man
Therefore
also
without objection
I came
having been summoned
I inquire
therefore
for what
reason
did you summon
me
And
-
Cornelius
was saying
Ago
four
days
until
this
the
hour
I was
at the
ninth hour
praying
in
the
house
of me
and
behold
a man
stood
before
me
in
apparel
bright
and
said
Cornelius
has been heard
your
-
prayer
and
the
alms
of you
have been remembered
before
-
God
Send
therefore
to
Joppa
and
call for
Simon
who
is called
Peter
He
lodges
in
[the] house
of Simon
a tanner
by
[the] sea
At once
therefore
I sent
to
you
you
then
well
did
having come
Now
therefore
all
we
before
-
God
are present
to hear
all
the things
having been commanded
you
by
the
Lord
Having opened
then
Peter
the
mouth
he said
Of
a truth
I understand
that
not
is
One who shows partiality
-
God
but
in
every
nation
the [one]
fearing
Him
and
working
righteousness
acceptable
to Him
is
the
word
that
He sent
to the
sons
of Israel
proclaiming the gospel
peace
by
Jesus
Christ
He
is
of all
Lord
You yourselves
know
the
having come
declaration
through
all
-
Judea
having begun
from
-
Galilee
after
the
baptism
that
proclaimed
John
Jesus
-
from
Nazareth
how
anointed
Him
-
God
Spirit
with Holy
and
with power
who
went about
doing good
and
healing
all
those
being oppressed
by
the
devil
because
-
God
was
with
Him
And
we
[are] witnesses
of all things
that
He did
in
both
the
region
of the
Jews
and
Jerusalem
whom
also
they put to death
having hanged [Him]
on
a tree
This One
-
God
raised up
on
the
third
day
and
gave
Him
manifest
to become
not
to all
the
people
but
to [the] witnesses
-
having been chosen beforehand
by
-
God
to us
who
did eat with
and
drink with
Him
after
-
rising
His
out from
[the] dead
And
He instructed
us
to proclaim
to the
people
and
to testify fully
that
He
is
the [One]
having been appointed
by
-
God
[as] judge
of living
and
dead
To Him
all
the
prophets
bear witness
[that] forgiveness
of sins
receives
through
the
name
of Him
everyone
-
believing
in
Him
Still
speaking
-
of Peter
the
words
these
fell
the
Spirit
-
Holy
upon
all
those
hearing
the
word
And
were amazed
the
from
[the] circumcision
believers
as many as
had come with
-
Peter
that
even
upon
the
Gentiles
the
gift
of the
Holy
Spirit
has been poured out
They were hearing
for
them
speaking
in tongues
and
magnifying
-
God
Then
answered
Peter
If not
the
water
is able
to withhold
anyone
-
not
to baptize
these
who
the
Spirit
-
Holy
have received
just as
also [have]
we
He commanded
now
them
in
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
to be baptized
Then
they asked
him
to remain
days
some
Heard
now
the
apostles
and
the
brothers
-
being
in
-
Judea
that
also
the
Gentiles
had received
the
word
-
of God
When
also
went up
Peter
to
Jerusalem
began contending
with
him
those
of
[the] circumcision
saying
-
You went
to
men
uncircumcision
having
and
ate with
them
Having begun
now
Peter
he set [it] forth
to them
in order
saying
I
was
in
[the] city
of Joppa
praying
and
I saw
in
a trance
a vision
descending
a vessel
certain
like
a sheet
great
by four
corners
being let down
out of
-
heaven
and
it came down
as far as
me
On
it
having looked intently
I was observing [it]
and
I saw
the
quadrupeds
of the
earth
and
the
wild beasts
and
the
creeping things
and
the
birds
of the
air
I heard
then
also
a voice
saying
to me
Having risen up
Peter
kill
and
eat
I said
however
In no way
Lord
for
common
or
unclean
nothing ever
has entered
into
the
mouth
of me
Answered
however
for
a second [time]
the voice
out of
-
heaven
What
-
God
has cleansed
you
not
do call unholy
This
now
happened
on
three times
and
was drawn up
again
all
into
-
heaven
And
behold
immediately
three
men
stood
at
the
house
in
which
I was
having been sent
from
Caesarea
to
me
Told
now
the
Spirit
me
to go with
them
not
having discriminated
Went
now
with
me
also
-
six
brothers
these
and
we entered
into
the
house
of the
man
He related
then
to us
how
he had seen
the
angel
in
the
house
of him
having stood
and
having said
Send forth
to
Joppa
and
send for
Simon
who
is called
Peter
who
will speak
words
to
you
in
which
will be saved
you
and
all
the
household
of you
In
then
-
beginning
my
to speak
fell
the
Spirit
-
Holy
upon
them
even as
also
upon
us
in [the]
beginning
I remembered
then
the
word
of the
Lord
how
He had said
John
indeed
baptized
with water
you
however
will be baptized
with [the]
Spirit
Holy
If
then
the
same
gift
has given
to them
-
God
as
also
to us
having believed
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
I
how
was
able
to forbid
-
God
Having heard
then
these things
they were silent
and
glorified
-
God
saying
Then indeed
also
to the
Gentiles
-
God
-
repentance
unto
life
has given
Those
indeed
therefore
having been scattered
by
the
tribulation
-
having taken place
over
Stephen
passed through
to
Phoenicia
and
Cyprus
and
Antioch
to no one
speaking
the
word
if
not
only
to Jews
Were
however
some
of
them
men
of Cyprus
and
of Cyrene
who
having come
into
Antioch
were speaking
also
to
the
Hellenists
proclaiming the gospel
the
Lord
Jesus
And
was
[the] hand
of [the] Lord
with
them
[a] great
then
number
-
having believed
turned
to
the
Lord
Was heard
now
the
report
in
the
ears
of the
church
-
being
in
Jerusalem
concerning
them
and
they sent forth
Barnabas
as far as
Antioch
who
having come
and
having seen
the
grace
of
-
God
rejoiced
and
was exhorting
all
with
resolute purpose
-
of heart
to abide
the
Lord
For
he was
a man
good
and
full
of [the] Spirit
Holy
and
of faith
And
was added
a crowd
large
to the
Lord
He went forth
then
to
Tarsus
to seek
Saul
and
having found [him]
he brought [him]
to
Antioch
It came to pass [that]
now
they
also
a year
whole
gathered together
in
the
church
and
taught
a crowd
large
Were called
then
first
in
Antioch
the
disciples
Christians
In
these
now
-
days
came down
from
Jerusalem
prophets
to
Antioch
Having risen up
now
one
of
them
named
Agabus
he signified
by
the
Spirit [that]
a famine
great
is about
to be
over
all
the
world
which
came to pass
under
Claudius
-
And
the disciples
as
was prospered
anyone
determined
each
of them
for
ministry
to send
to the
dwelling
in
-
Judea
brothers
which
also
they did
having sent [it]
to
the
elders
by [the]
hand
of Barnabas
and
Saul
At
that
now
-
time
put forth
Herod
the
king
the
hands
to mistreat
some
of those
of
the
church
He put to death
then
James
the
brother
of John
with the sword
Having seen
now
that
pleasing
it is
to the
Jews
he proceeded
to take
also
Peter
these were
now
days
of the
Unleavened [Bread]
whom
also
having seized
he put
in
prison
having delivered [him]
to four
sets of four
soldiers
to guard
him
intending
after
the
Passover
to bring out
him
to the
people
-
Indeed
therefore
Peter
was kept
in
the
prison
prayer
however
was
fervent
being made
by
the
church
to
-
God
concerning
him
When
then
was about
to bring forth
him
-
Herod
the
night
that
was
-
Peter
sleeping
between
two
soldiers
having been bound
with chains
two
guards
also
before
the
door
were watching
the
prison
And
behold
an angel
of [the] Lord
stood by
and
a light
shone
in
the
cell
Having struck
then
the
side
-
of Peter
he woke up
him
saying
Rise up
in
haste
And
fell
of him
the
chains
off
the
hands
Said
then
the
angel
to
him
Gird yourself about
and
put on
the
sandals
of you
He did
and
so
And
he says
to him
Wrap around [you]
the
cloak
of you
and
follow
me
And
having gone forth
he was following
and
not
did know
that
real
is
what
is happening
by means of
the
angel
he was thinking
however
a vision
he saw
Having passed through
then
a first
guard
and
a second
they came
to
the
gate
-
iron
-
leading
into
the
city
which
by itself
opened
to them
And
having gone out
they went on through
street
one
and
immediately
departed
the
angel
from
him
And
-
Peter
to
himself
having come
said
Now
I know
truly
that
has sent forth
the
Lord
the
angel
of Him
and
delivered
me
out of
[the] hand
of Herod
and
all
the
expectation
of the
people
of the
Jews
Having considered [it]
also
he came
to
the
house
of
Mary
the
mother
of John
who
is called
Mark
where
were
many
having gathered together
and
praying
Having knocked
then
of him
[at] the
door
of the
gate
came
a girl
to answer
named
Rhoda
And
having recognized
the
voice
-
of Peter
from
-
joy
not
she opened
the
gate
having run in
but
she reported
to be standing
-
Peter
before
the
gate
-
And
to
her
they said
You are out of your mind
-
But
she kept insisting
[it] so
to be
-
And
they kept saying
The
angel
it is
of him
-
But
Peter
continued
knocking
having opened [it]
then
they saw
him
and
were amazed
Having made a sign
then
to them
with the
hand
to be silent
he related
to them
how
the
Lord
him
had brought
out of
the
prison
He said
then
Report
to James
and
to the
brothers
these things
And
having gone out
he went
to
another
place
Having come
now
day
there was
disturbance
no
small
among
the
soldiers
what
then [of]
-
Peter
has become
Herod
then
having sought after
him
and
not
having found [him]
having examined
the
guards
he commanded [them]
to be led away [to death]
And
having gone down
from
-
Judea
to
Caesarea
he stayed [there]
He had been
now
furiously angry
with [the] Tyrians
and
Sidonians
with one accord
then
they came
to
him
And
having gained
Blastus
who [was]
over
the
bedchamber
of the
king
they were seeking
peace
because of
-
being nourished
their
-
region
by
the
kingâs
On the appointed
now
day
-
Herod
having put on
apparel
royal
having sat
on
the
throne
was making an address
to
them
-
And
the people
were crying out
Of a god
[this is the] voice
and
not
of a man
Immediately
then
struck
him
an angel
of [the] Lord
in return
for that
not
he gave
the
glory
-
to God
and
having been
eaten by worms
he breathed his last
-
But
the word
-
of God
continued to grow
and
to multiply
Barnabas
then
and
Saul
returned
to
Jerusalem
having fulfilled
the
mission
having taken with [them]
John
the [one]
having been called
Mark
There were
now
in
Antioch
in
the
being [there]
church
prophets
and
teachers
-
both
Barnabas
and
Simeon
who
was called
Niger
and
Lucius
the
Cyrenian
Manaen
also
Herod
the
tetrarch
brought up with
and
Saul
As were ministering
now
they
to the
Lord
and
fasting
said
the
Spirit
-
Holy
Set apart
then
to Me
-
Barnabas
and
Saul
for
the
work
to which
I have called
them
Then
having fasted
and
having prayed
and
having laid
the
hands
on them
they sent [them] off
They
indeed
therefore
having been sent forth
by
the
Holy
Spirit
went down
to
Seleucia
From there
then
they sailed
to
Cyprus
And
having come
into
Salamis
they began proclaiming
the
word
-
of God
in
the
synagogues
of the
Jews
They had
now
also
John [as]
a helper
Having passed through
now
all
the
island
as far as
Paphos
they found
a man
a certain
magician
a false prophet
Jewish
whose
name
[was] Bar-Jesus
who
was
with
the
proconsul
Sergius
Paulus
man
an intelligent
He
having called to [him]
Barnabas
and
Saul
desired
to hear
the
word
-
of God
Was opposing
however
them
Elymas
the
magician
thus
for
means
the
name
of him
seeking
to turn away
the
proconsul
from
the
faith
Saul
then
-
also [called]
Paul
having been filled
[the] Spirit
Holy
having looked intently
upon
him
said
O
full
of all
deceit
and
all
craft
son
of [the] devil
enemy
of all
righteousness
not
will you cease
perverting
the
ways
the
of Lord
-
straight
And
now
behold
[the] hand
of the Lord
[is] upon
you
and
you will be
blind
not
seeing
the
sun
during
a season
Immediately
then
fell
upon
him
mist
and
darkness
and
going about
he was seeking
someone to lead [him] by the hand
Then
having seen
the
proconsul
that
having happened
he believed
being astonished
at
the
teaching
of the
Lord
Having sailed
then
from
-
Paphos
[with] those
around [him]
Paul
came
to
Perga
-
of Pamphylia
John
however
having departed
from
them
returned
to
Jerusalem
They
now
having passed through
from
-
Perga
came
to
Antioch
-
of Pisidia
and
having gone
into
the
synagogue
on the
day
of the
Sabbaths
they sat down
After
then
the
reading
of the
law
and
of the
Prophets
sent
the
rulers of the synagogue
to
them
saying
Men
brothers
if
any
there is
among
you
a word
of exhortation
toward
the
people
speak
Having risen up
then
Paul
and
having made a sign
with the
hand
he said
Men
Israelites
and
those
fearing
-
God
listen
The
God
of the
people
this
of Israel
chose
the
fathers
of us
and
the
people
exalted
in
the
sojourn
in
[the] land
of Egypt
and
with
arm
uplifted
brought
them
out of
it
and
of about
forty years
for a period
He endured the ways
their
in
the
wilderness
and
having destroyed
nations
seven
in
[the] land
of Canaan
He gave as an inheritance
the
land
of them
during
years
four hundred
and
fifty
And
after
these things
He gave [them]
judges
until
Samuel
prophet
Then
they asked for
a king
and
gave
to them
-
God
-
Saul
son
of Kish
a man
of [the]
tribe
of Benjamin
years
forty
And
having removed
him
He raised up
-
David
to them
as
king
to whom
also
He said
having carried witness
I have found
David
the
[son]
of Jesse
a man
according to
the
heart
of Me
who
will do
all
the
will
of Me
Of this [man]
-
God
of
the
seed
according to
promise
has brought
-
to Israel
[the] Savior
Jesus
having proclaimed
John
before [the]
face
of the
coming
of Him
a baptism
of repentance
to all
the
people
of Israel
While
then
was fulfilling
John
the
course
he was saying
Whom
me
do you suppose
to be
Not
am
I [he]
but
behold
He comes
after
me
of whom
not
I am
worthy
a
sandal
of the
feet
to untie
Men
brothers
sons
of [the] family
of Abraham
and
those
among
you
fearing
-
God
to us
the
message
of the
salvation
this
has been sent
Those
for
dwelling
in
Jerusalem
and
the
rulers
of them
Him
not having known
and
the
voices
of the
prophets
that
on
every
Sabbath
are being read
having condemned [Him]
they fulfilled [them]
And
no
cause
of death
having found
they begged
Pilate
to put to death
him
When
then
they had finished
all
the things
about
Him
having been written
having taken [Him] down
from
the
tree
they put [Him]
in
a tomb
-
But
God
raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
who
appeared
for
days
many
to those
having come up with
Him
from
-
Galilee
to
Jerusalem
who
now
are
witnesses
of Him
to
the
people
And
we
to you
preach the gospel
the
to
the
fathers
promise
having been made
that
this
-
God
has fulfilled
to the
children
to us
having raised up
Jesus
as
also
in
the
psalm
it has been written
the
second
Son
of Me
are
You
I
today
have begotten
you
That
then
He raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
no more
being about
to return
to
decay
thus
He spoke
-
I will give
to you
the
holy [blessings]
of David
the
sure [blessings]
Therefore
also
in
another
He says
Not
You will allow
the
Holy One
of you
to see
decay
David
indeed
for
in his own
generation
having served
the
-
of God
purpose
fell asleep
and
was added
to
the
fathers
of him
and
saw
decay
The [One]
however
-
God
raised up
not
did see
decay
Known
therefore
be it
to you
men
brothers
that
through
this One
to you
forgiveness
of sins
is proclaimed
And
from
all things
from which
not
you were able
in
[the] law
of Moses
to be justified






Take heed
therefore
lest
might come about
that
having been said
in
the
prophets
Behold
-
scoffers
and
wonder
and
perish
for
a work
am working
I
in
the
days
of you
a work
that
never
not
you would believe
even if
one
should declare it
to you
Having departed
then
they
were begging
on
the
next
Sabbath
to be spoken
to them
the
words
these
Having broken up
then
the
synagogue
followed
many
of the
Jews
and
of the
worshipping
converts
-
Paul
and
-
Barnabas
who
speaking
to them
kept persuading
them
to continue
in the
grace
-
of God
On the
now
coming
Sabbath
almost
all
the
city
was gathered together
to hear
the
word
-
of the Lord
Having seen
however
the
Jews
the
crowds
they were filled
with jealousy
and
began contradicting
the things
by
Paul
spoken
blaspheming
Having spoken boldly
also
-
Paul
and
-
Barnabas
said
To you
it was
necessary
first
to be spoken
the
word
-
of God
but since
you thrust away
it
and
not
worthy
you judge
yourselves
-
of eternal
life
behold
we are turning
to
the
Gentiles
Thus
for
has commanded
us
the
Lord
I have set
you
for
a light
of [the] Gentiles
-
to be
you
for
salvation
to
[the] uttermost part
of the
earth
Hearing [it]
then
the
Gentiles
were rejoicing
and
glorifying
the
word
of the
Lord
and
believed
as many as
were
appointed
to
life
eternal
Was carried
then
the
word
of the
Lord
through
all
the
region
The
but
Jews
incited
the
worshipping
women
-
of honorable position
and
the
principals
of the
city
and
they stirred up
a persecution
against
-
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
expelled
them
from
the
district
of them
-
But
having shaken off
the
dust
of the
feet
against
them
they went
to
Iconium
-
and
the disciples
were filled
with joy
and [the]
Spirit
Holy
It came to pass
now
in
Iconium
according to
the
same
entered
they
into
the
synagogue
of the
Jews
and
spoke
so
that
believed
of Jewish
both
and
Greeks
a great
number
The
however
unbelieving
Jews
stirred up
and
poisoned
the
minds
of the
Gentiles
against
the
brothers
A long
indeed
therefore
time
they stayed
speaking boldly
for
the
Lord
the [One]
bearing witness
to
the
word
of the
grace
of Him
granting
signs
and
wonders
to be done
through
the
hands
of them
Was divided
now
the
multitude
of the
city
and
some
indeed
were
with
the
Jews
some
however
with
the
apostles
When
then
there was
a rush
of the
Gentiles
both
and
Jews
with
the
rulers
of them
to mistreat
and
to stone
them
having become aware
they fled
to
the
cities
-
of Lycaonia
Lystra
and
Derbe
and
the
surrounding region
and there
preaching the gospel
they continued
And
a certain
man
crippled
in
Lystra
in the
feet
was sitting
lame
from
[the] womb
of [the] mother
of him
who
never
had walked
This [man]
heard
-
Paul
speaking
who
having looked intently
at him
and
having seen
that
he has
faith
-
to be healed
said
in a loud
voice
Stand
on
the
feet
of you
upright
And
he sprang up
and
began to walk
-
And
the crowds
having seen
what
had done
Paul
lifted up
the
voice
of them
in Lycaonian
saying
The
gods
having become like
men
have come down
to
us
They began calling
then
-
Barnabas
Zeus
-
and
Paul
Hermes
because
he
was
the
leading
-
speaker
-
And
the priest
-
of Zeus
-
being
just outside
the
city
oxen
and
wreaths
to
the
gates
having brought
with
the
crowds
was desiring
to sacrifice
Having heard
however
the
apostles
Barnabas
and
Paul
having torn
the
garments
of them
rushed out
into
the
crowd
crying out
and
saying
Men
why
these things
do you
Also
we
of like nature
are
with you
men
proclaiming the gospel
to you
from
these
-
vanities
to turn
to
God
[the] living
who
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
the things
in
them
who
in
the
past
generations
allowed
all
the
nations
to go
the
ways
of them
And yet
not
without witness
Himself
He has left
doing good
from heaven
to you
rains
giving
and
seasons
fruitful
filling
with food
and
gladness
the
hearts
of you
And
these things
saying
hardly
they stopped
the
crowds
-
not
sacrificing
to them
Came
however
from
Antioch
and
Iconium
Jews
and
having persuaded
the
crowds
and
having stoned
-
Paul
they dragged [him]
outside
the
city
supposing
him
to have died
Having surrounded
however
the
disciples
him
having risen up
he entered
into
the
city
And
on the
next day
he went away
with
-
Barnabas
to
Derbe
Having proclaimed the gospel to
then
the
city
that
and
having discipled
many
they returned
to
-
Lystra
and
to
Iconium
and
to
Antioch
strengthening
the
souls
of the
disciples
exhorting [them]
to continue
in the
faith
and
that
through
many
tribulations
it behooves
us
to enter
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
Having chosen
now
for them
in every
church
elders
having prayed
with
fasting
they committed
them
to the
Lord
in
whom
they had believed
And
having passed through
-
Pisidia
they came
to
-
Pamphylia
and
having spoken
in
Perga
the
word
they went down
to
Attalia
And from there
they sailed
to
Antioch
from where
they had
been committed
to the
grace
-
of God
for
the
work
that
they had fulfilled
Having arrived
now
and
having gathered together
the
church
they began declaring
all that
had done
-
God
with
them
and
that
He had opened
to the
Gentiles
a door
of faith
They remained
then
time
no
little
with
the
disciples
And
certain ones
having come down
from
-
Judea
were teaching
the
brothers
-
If
not
you are circumcised
according to the
custom
-
of Moses
not
you are able
to be saved
Having been brought about
then
commotion
and
discussion
no
small
-
by Paul
and
-
Barnabas
with
them
they appointed
to go up
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
certain
others
out from
them
to
the
apostles
and
elders
to
Jerusalem
about
the
question
this
They
indeed
therefore
having been sent forward
by
the
church
were passing through
-
both
Phoenicia
and
Samaria
relating in detail
the
conversion
of the
Gentiles
and
they were bringing
joy
great
to all
the
brothers
Having come
then
to
Jerusalem
they were welcomed
by
the
church
and
the
apostles
and
the
elders
They declared
then
all that
-
God
had done
with
them
Rose up
now
certain
of those
of
the
sect
of the
Pharisees
who believed
saying
-
It is necessary
to circumcise
them
to command [them]
then
to keep
the
law
of Moses
Were gathered together
then
the
apostles
and
the
elders
to see
about
the
matter
this
Of much
now
discussion
having taken place
having risen up
Peter
said
to
them
Men
brothers
you
know
that
from
days
early
among
you
chose
-
God
by
the
mouth
of me
to hear
the
Gentiles
the
word
of the
gospel
and
to believe
And
the
heart-knowing
God
bore witness
to them
having given [them]
the
Spirit
-
Holy
as
also
to us
and
not one
He made distinction
between
us
also
and
them
by the
faith
having purified
the
hearts
of them
Now
therefore
why
are you testing
-
God
to put
a yoke
upon
the
neck
of the
disciples
that
neither
the
fathers
of us
nor
we
have been able
to bear
But
by
the
grace
of
[the] Lord
Jesus
we believe
to be saved
in
[the] same
manner [as]
they also
Kept silent
now
all
the
multitude
and
were listening to
Barnabas
and
Paul
relating
what
had done
-
God
signs
and
wonders
among
the
Gentiles
by
them
After
now
-
were silent
they
answered
James
saying
Men
brothers
hear
me
Simeon
has related
how
first
-
God
visited
to take
out of
[the] Gentiles
a people
for the
name
of Him
And
with this
agree
the
words
of the
prophets
as
it is written
After
these things
I will return
and
will rebuild
the
tabernacle
of David
which
has fallen
and
the
ruins
of it
I will rebuild
and
I will set upright
it
so that
-
may seek out
the
remnant
-
of men
the
Lord
and
all
the
Gentiles
upon
whom
has been called
the
name
of Me
upon
them
says
[the] Lord
doing
these things
known
from
eternity
Therefore
I
judge
not
to trouble
those who
from
the
Gentiles
are turning
to
-
God
but
to write
to them
-
to abstain from
the
pollutions
of the
idols
and
-
sexual immorality
and
which is strangled
and
from
blood
Moses
for
from
generations
of old
in every
city
[ones]
proclaiming
him
has
in
the
synagogues
on
every
Sabbath
being read
Then
it seemed good
to the
apostles
and
to the
elders
with
all
the
church
having chosen
men
out from
them
to send
to
Antioch
with
-
Paul
and
Barnabas
Judas
-
called
Barsabbas
and
Silas
men
leading
among
the
brothers
having written
by
[the] hand
of them
The
apostles
and
the
elders
brothers
To those
in
-
Antioch
and
Syria
and
Cilicia
brothers
-
among
the Gentiles
Greetings
Inasmuch as
we have heard
that
some
from
us
troubled
you
by words
upsetting
the
minds
of you
to whom
not
we had given instructions
it seemed good
to us
having come
with one accord
having chosen
men
to send
to
you
with
the
beloved
of us
Barnabas
and
Paul
men
having handed over
the
lives
of them
for
the
name
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
We have sent
therefore
Judas
and
Silas
and
they
by
word [of mouth]
are telling [you]
the
same things
It seemed good
for
to the
Spirit
-
Holy
and
to us
no
further
to lay
upon you
burden
except
these
-
necessary things
to abstain
from things sacrificed to idols
and
from blood
and
from what is strangled
and
from sexual immorality
From
these
keeping
yourselves
well
you will do
Farewell
They
indeed
therefore
having been sent off
went
to
Antioch
and
having gathered
the
multitude
they delivered
the
letter
Having read [it]
now
they rejoiced
at
the
encouragement
Judas
both
and
Silas
also
themselves
prophets
being
by
talk
much
exhorted
the
brothers
and
strengthened [them]
Having continued
then
a time
they were sent away
in
peace
from
the
brothers
to
those
having sent
them
Paul
however
and
Barnabas
stayed
in
Antioch
teaching
and
proclaiming the good news
with
also
others
many
the
word
of the
Lord
After
now
some
days
said
to
Barnabas
Paul
Having turned back
indeed
let us look after
the
brothers
in
city
every
in
which
we have announced
the
word
of the
Lord
how
they are
Barnabas
now
purposed
to take along
also
-
John
-
called
Mark
Paul
however
thought fit
the [one]
having withdrawn
from
them
from
Pamphylia
and
not
having gone with
them
to
the
work
not
to take along
him
Arose
therefore
a sharp disagreement
so that
separated
they
from
one another
-
and
Barnabas
having taken
-
Mark
sailed
to
Cyprus
Paul
however
having chosen
Silas
went forth
having been committed
to the
grace
of the
Lord
by
the
brothers
He was passing through
then
-
Syria
and
Cilicia
strengthening
the
churches
He came
then
also
to
Derbe
and
to
Lystra
And
behold
a disciple
certain
was
there
named
Timothy
[the] son
of a woman
Jewish
believing
father
however
a Greek
who
was well spoken of
by
the
in
Lystra
and
Iconium
brothers
This one
wanted
-
Paul
with
him
to go forth
and
having taken
he circumcised
him
on account of
the
Jews
-
being
in
the
parts
those
they knew
for
all
that
a Greek
the
father
of him
was
While
then
they were passing through
the
cities
they were delivering
to them
to keep
the
decrees
-
decided on
by
the
apostles
and
elders
who [were]
in
Jerusalem
The
indeed
therefore
churches
were strengthened
in the
faith
and
were increasing
-
in number
every
day
Having passed through
then
-
Phrygia
and
the Galatian
region
having been forbidden
by
the
Holy
Spirit
to speak
the
word
in
-
Asia
having come
then
down to
-
Mysia
they were attempting
into
-
Bithynia
to go
and
not
did allow
them
the
Spirit
of Jesus
having passed by
then
-
Mysia
they came down
to
Troas
And
a vision
during
night
-
to Paul
appeared
A man
of Macedonia
certain
was
standing
and
beseeching
him
and
saying
Having passed over
into
Macedonia
help
us
When
now
the
vision
he had seen
immediately
we sought
to go forth
to
Macedonia
concluding
that
had called
us
-
God
to preach the gospel
to them
Having sailed
then
from
Troas
we made a straight course
to
Samothrace
-
and
the following day
to
Nea
Polis
and from there
to
Philippi
which
is
[the] leading
of the
district
of Macedonia
city
a colony
We were
now
in
this
-
city
staying
days
some
On the
then
day
of the
Sabbaths
we went forth
outside
the
city gate
by
a river
where
was customary
[a place of] prayer
to be
And
having sat down
we began speaking
to the
having gathered
women
And
a certain
woman
named
Lydia
a seller of purple
of [the] city
of Thyatira
worshiping
-
God
was listening
of whom
the
Lord
opened
the
heart
to attend
to the things
being spoken
by
Paul
When
then
she was baptized
and
the
house
of her
she begged
saying
If
you have judged
me
faithful
to the
Lord
to be
having entered
into
the
house
of me
abide
And
she persuaded
us
It happened
now
going
of us
to
the
[place of] prayer
a girl
certain
having
a spirit
of Python
met
us
who
gain
much
was bringing
the
masters
of her
by fortune-telling
She
having followed
-
Paul
and
us
was crying out
saying
These
-
men
servants
of the
God
-
Most High
are
who
proclaim
to you
[the] way
of salvation
This
then
she continued
for
many
days
Having been distressed
then
Paul
and
having turned
to the
spirit
he said
I command
you
in
[the] name
of Jesus
Christ
to come out
from
her
And
it came out
[the] same
-
hour
Having seen
now
the
masters
of her
that
was gone
the
hope
of the
profit
of them
having taken hold of
-
Paul
and
-
Silas
they dragged [them]
into
the
marketplace
before
the
rulers
and
having brought up
them
to the
magistrates
they said
These
-
men
exceedingly trouble
of us
the
city
Jews
being
and
preach
customs
that
not
it is lawful
for us
to accept
nor
to practice
Romans
being
And
rose up together
the
crowd
against
them
and
the
magistrates
having torn off
of them
the
garments
were commanding that
they be beaten with rods
Many
then
having laid
on them
blows
they cast [them]
into
prison
having charged
the
jailer
securely
to keep
them
who
an order
such
having received
threw
them
into
the
inner
prison
and
the
feet
fastened
of them
in
the
stocks
Toward
now
-
midnight
Paul
and
Silas
praying
were singing praises to
-
God
Were listening
now
to them
the
prisoners
Suddenly
then
earthquake
there was
a great
so that
were shaken
the
foundations
of the
prison house
were opened
then
immediately
the
doors
all
and
of all
the
chains
were loosed
Awoken
then
having been
the
jailer
and
having seen
open
the
doors
of the
prison
having drawn
his
sword
he was about
himself
to kill
supposing
to have escaped
the
prisoners
Called out
however
Paul
loud
in a voice
saying
Not
do
to yourself
harm
all
for
we are
here
Having called for
now
lights
he rushed in
and
terrified
having become
he fell down before
-
Paul
and
Silas
And
having brought
them
out
he was saying
Sirs
what
of me
is necessary
to do
that
I may be saved
-
And
they said
Believe
on
the
Lord
Jesus
and
you will be saved
you
and
the
household
of you
And
they spoke
to him
the
word
of the
Lord
along with
all
those
in
the
house
of him
And
having taken
them
in
that
-
hour
of the
night
he washed [them]
from
the
wounds
and
he was baptized
he
and
the [household]
of him
all
immediately
Having brought
then
them
into
the
house
he laid
a table [for them]
and
rejoiced
with all [his] household
having believed
-
in God
Day
then
having come
sent
the
magistrates
the
officers
saying
Release
the
men
those
Reported
then
the
jailer
the
words
these
to
-
Paul
-
Have sent
the
captains
that
you may be let go
Now
therefore
having gone out
depart
in
peace
-
But
Paul
was saying
to
them
Having beaten
us
publicly
uncondemned
men
Romans
being
they cast [us]
into
prison
and
now
secretly
us
do they throw out
No
indeed
Instead
having come
themselves
us
let them bring out
Reported
then
to the
captains
the
officers
the
words
these
They were afraid
then
having heard
that
Romans
they are
And
having come
they appealed to
them
and
having brought [them] out
they were asking [them]
to go out
of
the
city
Having gone forth
then
out of
the
prison
they came
to
-
Lydia
and
having seen [them]
they exhorted
the
brothers
and
departed
Having passed through
then
-
Amphipolis
and
-
Apollonia
they came
to
Thessalonica
where
was
a synagogue
of the
Jews
According to
now
the
custom
-
with Paul
he went in
to
them
and
for
Sabbaths
three
he reasoned
with them
from
the
Scriptures
opening
and
setting forth
that
the
Christ
it behooved
to have suffered
and
to have risen
out from
[the] dead
and
that
this
is
the
Christ
-
Jesus
whom
I
preach
to you
And
some
of
them
were obedient
and
joined themselves
-
to Paul
and
-
to Silas
-
along with
worshipping
Greeks
a multitude
great
women
then
of the
leading
not
a few
Having become jealous
now
the
Jews
and
having taken to [them]
of the
market-loungers
men
certain
wicked
and
having collected a crowd
they set in uproar
the
city
and
having assailed
the
house
of Jason
they were seeking
them
to bring out
to
the
people
Not
having found
however
them
they dragged
Jason
and
certain
brothers
before
the
city authorities
crying out
-
The [ones]
the
world
having upset
these
also
here
are come
whom
has received
Jason
And
these
all
contrary to
the
decrees
of Caesar
do
king
another
proclaiming
to be
Jesus
They stirred up
then
the
crowd
and
the
city authorities
hearing
these things
And
having taken
-
security
from
-
Jason
and
the
rest
they let go
them
-
And
the brothers
immediately
by
night
sent away
-
both
Paul
and
-
Silas
to
Berea
who
having arrived
into
the
synagogue
of the
Jews
went
These
now
were
more noble
than those
in
Thessalonica
who
received
the
word
with
all
readiness
on the
every
day
examining
the
Scriptures
if
were
these things
so
Many
indeed
therefore
of
them
believed
and
of the
Grecian
women
-
prominent
and
men
not
a few
When
however
knew
those
from
-
Thessalonica
Jews
that
also
in
-
Berea
was proclaimed
by
-
Paul
the
word
-
of God
they came
there also
stirring up
and
agitating
the
crowds
Immediately
also
then
-
Paul
sent away
the
brothers
to go
as
to
the
sea
remained
but
-
both
Silas
and
-
Timothy
there
Those
now
escorting
-
Paul
brought [him]
unto
Athens
and
having received
a command
unto
-
Silas
and
-
Timothy
that
as
quickly as possible
they should come
to
him
they departed
In
now
-
Athens
waiting for
them
-
of Paul
was provoked
the
spirit
of him
in
him
seeing
utterly idolatrous
to be
the
city
He was reasoning
indeed
therefore
in
the
synagogue
with the
Jews
and
those
worshiping
and
in
the
marketplace
on
every
day
with
those
meeting [him]
Some
then
also
of the
Epicureans
and
Stoics
philosophers
encountered
him
And
some
were saying
What
-
may desire
of the
babbler
this
to say
Others
however
Of foreign
gods
he seems
a proclaimer
to be
because
-
Jesus
and
the
resurrection
he was proclaiming the gospel of
Having taken hold
also
of him
to
the
Ares
Hill
they brought [him]
saying
Are we able
to know
what [is]
the
new
this
which
by
you
is spoken
teaching
Strange things
for
some
you are bringing
to
the
ears
of us
We resolve
therefore
to know
what
wish
these things
to be
[The] Athenians
now
all
and
the
visiting
strangers
in
nothing
else
spent their time
than
to tell
something
and
to hear
something
new
Having stood
then
Paul
in
[the] midst
of the
Ares
Hill
he was saying
Men
Athenians
in
all things
as
very religious
you
I behold
Passing through
for
and
beholding
the
objects of worship
of you
I found
even
an altar
on
which
had been inscribed
To an unknown
God
Whom
therefore
not knowing
you worship
Him
I
proclaim
to you
The
God
-
having made
the
world
and
all things
that [are]
in
it
He
of heaven
and
earth
being
Lord
not
in
hand-made
temples
dwells
nor
by
hands
of men
is He served
as needing
anything
Himself
giving
to all
life
and
breath
and
the
all
He made
then
of
one
every
nation
of men
to dwell
upon
all
the face
of the
earth
having determined
[the] appointed
times
and
the
boundaries
of the
habitation
of them
to seek
-
God
if
perhaps
indeed
they might palpate for
Him
and
might find Him
And
indeed
not
far
from
one
each
of us
He is
In
Him
for
we live
and
move
and
are
As
also
some
of the
among
you
poets
have said
Of [Him]
for
also
offspring
we are
Offspring
therefore
being
-
of God
not
we ought
to consider
to gold
or
to silver
or
to stone
a graven thing
of craft
and
imagination
of man
the
Divine Being
to be
like
The
indeed
therefore
times
-
of ignorance
having overlooked
-
God
-
now
He commands
-
men
all
everywhere
to repent
because
He set
a day
in
which
He is about
to judge
the
world
in
righteousness
by
a man
whom
He appointed
a guarantee
having provided
to all
having raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
Having heard of
now
a resurrection
of [the] dead
some
indeed
began to mock [him]
some
however
said
We will hear
you
concerning
this
also
again
Thus
-
Paul
went out
from
[the] midst
of them
Some
however
men
having joined themselves
to him
believed
among
whom
also
[were] Dionysius
the
Areopagite
and
a woman
named
Damaris
and
others
with
them
And after
these things
having departed
from
-
Athens
he came
to
Corinth
And
having found
a certain
Jew
named
Aquila
of Pontus
-
a native
recently
having come
from
-
Italy
and
Priscilla
wife
of him
because of
-
having commanded
Claudius
to depart
all
the
Jews
out of
-
Rome
he came
to them
and
due to
of the
same trade
being
he stayed
with
them
and
worked
they were
for
tentmakers
by the
trade
He was reasoning
now
in
the
synagogue
on
every
Sabbath
persuading
both
Jews
and
Greeks
When
now
came down
from
-
Macedonia
-
both
Silas
and
-
Timothy
was occupied
with the
word
-
Paul
earnestly testifying
to the
Jews
to be
the
Christ
Jesus
Opposing
however
of them
and
reviling [him]
having shaken out
the
garments
he said
to
them
The
blood
of You
[be] upon
the
head
of you
clean
I [am]
From
-
now on
to
the
Gentiles
I will go
And
having departed
from there
he came
to [the]
house
of a certain one
named
Titius
Justus
worshiping
-
God
of whom
the
house
was
adjoining
the
synagogue
Crispus
now
the
ruler of the synagogue
believed
in the
Lord
with
all
the
household
of him
And
many
of the
Corinthians
hearing
believed
and
were baptized
Said
now
the
Lord
in [the]
night
through
a vision
-
to Paul
Not
fear
but
continue speaking
and
not
be silent
because
I
am
with
you
and
no one
will lay a hand on
you
-
to harm
you
because
people
there are
to me
many
in
the
city
this
He remained
now
a year
and
months
six
teaching
among
them
the
word
-
of God
Gallio
however
proconsul
being
of
Achaia
rose up against
with one accord
the
Jews
-
Paul
and
led
him
to
the
judgment seat
saying
-
Contrary to
the
law
persuades
this [man]
-
men
to worship
-
God
Being about
now
-
Paul
to open
the
mouth
said
-
Gallio
to
the
Jews
If
indeed
it was
unrighteousness
some
or
crime
wicked
O
Jews
according to
reason
-
I would have endured with
you
if
however
a question
it is
about
a word
and
names
and
law
-
in reference to
your
you will see
[to it] yourselves
a judge
I
of these things
not
resolve
to be
And
he drove
them
from
the
judgment seat
Having seized
then
all [of them]
Sosthenes
the
ruler of the synagogue
they began to beat [him]
before
the
judgment seat
And
nothing
about these things
-
to Gallio
it mattered
-
Now
Paul
more
having remained
days
many
the
brothers
having taken leave of
sailed away
to
-
Syria
and
with
him
Priscilla
and
Aquila
having shaved
in
Cenchrea
the
head
he had
for
a vow
They came
now
to
Ephesus
and them
left
there
He himself
then
having entered
into
the
synagogue
he reasoned
with the
Jews
Asking [him]
now
of them
for
a longer
time
to remain
not
he did consent
but
having taken leave
and
having said
Again
I will return
to
you
-
God
willing
he sailed
from
-
Ephesus
and
having landed
at
Caesarea
having gone up
and
having greeted
the
church
he went down
to
Antioch
And
having stayed
time
some
he went forth
passing through
successively
the
Galatian
region
and
Phrygia
strengthening
all
the
disciples
A Jew
now
certain
Apollos
named
of Alexandria
-
a native
a man
eloquent
came
to
Ephesus
mighty
being
in
the
Scriptures
He
was
instructed in
the
way
of the
Lord
And
being fervent
-
in spirit
he was speaking
and
was teaching
earnestly
the things
concerning
-
Jesus
knowing
only
the
baptism
of John
He
then
began
to speak boldly
in
the
synagogue
Having heard
however
him
Priscilla
and
Aquila
they took to [them]
him
and
more accurately
to him
expounded
the
way
of
God
Resolving
then
he
to pass through
into
-
Achaia
having encouraged [him]
the
brothers
wrote
to the
disciples
to welcome
him
who
having arrived
helped
greatly
those
having believed
through
-
grace
Powerfully
for
the
Jews
he was refuting
publicly
showing
by
the
Scriptures
to be
the
Christ
Jesus
It came to pass
now
while
-
-
Apollos
was
in
Corinth
Paul
having passed through
the
upper
parts
to come
to
Ephesus
and
having found
certain
disciples
he said
also
to
them
If
[the] Spirit
Holy
did you receive
having believed
-
And [they said]
to
him
But
not even
that [a]
Spirit
Holy
there is
did we hear
He said
then
Into
what
then
were you baptized
-
And
they said
Into
-
John's
baptism
Said
then
Paul
John
baptized
a baptism
of repentance
the
people
telling
in
the [One]
coming
after
him
that
they should believe
that
is
in
-
Jesus
Having heard
then
they were baptized
in
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
And
having laid
on them
-
Paul
hands
came
the
Spirit
-
Holy
upon
them
they were speaking
then
in tongues
and
prophesying
There were
then
the
in all
men
about
twelve
Having entered
then
into
the
synagogue
he was speaking boldly
for
months
three
reasoning
and
persuading
concerning
the
kingdom
-
of God
When
however
some
were hardened
and
were disbelieving
speaking evil of
the
Way
before
the
multitude
having departed
from
them
he took separately
the
disciples
every
day
reasoning
in
the
lecture hall
of Tyrannus
This
then
continued
for
years
two
so that
all
those
inhabiting
-
Asia
heard
the
word
of the
Lord
Jews
both
and
Greeks
Miracles
then
not
-
being ordinary
-
God
was performing
by
the
hands
of Paul
so that
even
to
the
ailing
were brought
from
the
skin
of him
handkerchiefs
or
aprons
and
departed
from
them
the
diseases
the
also
spirits
-
evil
left
Attempted
now
some of
also
of the
itinerant
Jews
exorcists
to invoke
over
those
having
-
spirits
-
evil
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
saying
I adjure
you
[by]
Jesus
whom
Paul
proclaims
They were
now
certain
of Sceva
a Jew
a high priest
seven
sons
this
were doing
Answering
however
the
spirit
-
evil
said
to them
-
Jesus
I know
and
-
Paul
I am acquainted with
you
however
who
are you
And
having leapt
the
man
on
them
in
whom
was
the
spirit
-
evil
having overpowered
them all
he prevailed
against
them
so that
naked
and
wounded
they fled
out of
the
house
that
This
now
became
known
to all
Jews
both
and
Greeks
those
inhabiting
-
Ephesus
and
fell
fear
upon
all
them
and
was being magnified
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Many
then
of those
having believed
were coming
confessing
and
declaring
the
deeds
of them
Many
now
of those
the
magic arts
having practiced
having brought
the
books
burned [them]
before
all
And
they counted up
the
prices
of them
and
found [it]
of silverlings
myriads
five
Thus
with
might
of the
Lord
the
word
continued to increase
and
prevail
After
now
were fulfilled
these things
purposed
-
Paul
in
the
Spirit
having passed through
-
Macedonia
and
Achaia
to go
to
Jerusalem
having said
-
After
-
having been
my
there
it behooves
me
also
Rome
to see
Having sent
then
into
-
Macedonia
two
of those
ministering
to him
Timothy
and
Erastus
he
remained
for a time
in
-
Asia
Arose
now
at
the
time
same
a disturbance
not
small
concerning
the
Way
Demetrius
for
a certain [man]
named
a silversmith
making
shrines
silver
of Artemis
was bringing
to the
craftsmen
no
little
business
whom
having brought together
also
the
in
such
things
workmen
he said
Men
you know
that
from
this
-
business
the
wealth
of us
is
And
you see
and
hear
that
not
only
in Ephesus
but
almost
all
-
of Asia
-
Paul
this
having persuaded [them]
has turned away
a great many
people
saying
that
not
they are
gods
-
by
hands
being made
Not
only
but
this
is endangered
to us
the
business
into
disrepute
to come
but
also
the
of the
great
goddess
Artemis
temple
for
nothing
to be reckoned
to be
and
also
deposed
the
majesty
of her
whom
all
-
Asia
and
the
world
worship
Having heard
then
and
having become
full
of rage
they were crying out
saying
Great [is]
-
Artemis
of [the] Ephesians
And
was filled
the
city
whole
with confusion
they rushed
and
with one accord
to
the
theatre
having dragged off
Gaius
and
Aristarchus
Macedonians
fellow travelers
of Paul
Of Paul
however
intending
to go in
to
the
people
not
would allow
him
the
disciples
Some
then
also
of the
Asiarchs
being
to him
friends
having sent
to
him
were urging [him]
not
to venture
himself
into
the
theatre
Others
indeed
therefore
some
thing
were crying out
was
for
the
assembly
confused
and
-
most
not
did know
for what
cause
they were assembled
Out of
now
the
crowd
to explain himself
Alexander
having thrust forward
him
the
Jews
-
And
Alexander
having motioned with
the
hand
was wanting
to make a defense
to the
people
Having recognized
however
that
a Jew
he is
a cry
there was
one
from
all
about
ongoing
hours
two
crying out
Great [is]
-
Artemis
of [the] Ephesians
Having calmed
then
the
town clerk
the
crowd
he says
Men
Ephesians
what
for
is there
man
who
not
knows
the
of [the] Ephesians
city
temple-keeper
as being
of the
great
Artemis
and
of that
fallen from the sky
Undeniable
therefore
being
these things
necessary
it is
for you
calm
to be
and
nothing
rash
to do
You brought
for
the
men
these
neither
temple plunderers
nor
blaspheming
the
goddess
of us
If
indeed
therefore
Demetrius
and
the
with
him
craftsmen
have
against
anyone
a matter
courts
are conducted
and
proconsuls
there are
let them accuse
one another
If
however
anything
beyond this
you inquire
in
the
lawful
assembly
it will be solved
And
for
we are in danger of
being accused
of insurrection
in regard to
-
this day
not one
cause
there existing
concerning
which
not
we will be able
to give
a reason
for
the
commotion
this
And
these things
having said
he dismissed
the
assembly
After
now
-
had ceased
the
uproar
having called to [him]
-
Paul
the
disciples
and
having encouraged
having said farewell
he departed
to go
to
Macedonia
Having passed through
then
the
districts
those
and
having exhorted
them
with talk
much
he came
to
-
Greece
Having continued
then
months
three
having been made
a plot
against him
by
the
Jews
he being about
to sail
into
-
Syria
arose
a purpose
-
to return
through
Macedonia
Was accompanied by
then
he
Sopater
Pyrrhus
a Berean
of the Thessalonians
now
Aristarchus
and
Secundus
and
Gaius
of Derbe
and
Timothy
[the] Asians
now
Tychicus
and
Trophimus
These
also
having gone ahead
waited for
us
in
Troas
We
then
sailed away
after
the
days
of the
Unleavened Bread
from
Philippi
and
we came
to
them
at
-
Troas
within
days
five
where
we stayed
days
seven
In
then
the
first [day]
of the
week
having come together
we
to break
bread
-
Paul
talked
to them
about
to depart
on the
next day
he continued
then
the
talk
until
midnight
There were
now
lamps
many
in
the
upper room
where
we were
assembled
Was sitting
then
a certain
young man
named
Eutychus
by
the
window
overpowered
by sleep
deep
as talked
-
Paul
on
longer
having been overpowered
by
the
sleep
he fell
from
the
third story
down
and
was picked up
dead
Having descended
however
-
Paul
fell upon
him
and
having embraced [him]
said
Not
be alarmed
the
for
life
of him
in
him
is
Having gone up
then
and
having broken
the
bread
and
having eaten
for
long
and
having talked
until
daybreak
so
he departed
They brought
then
the
boy
alive
and
were comforted
not
a little
We
however
having gone ahead
to
the
ship
sailed
to
-
Assos
there
being about
to take in
-
Paul
Thus
for
having arranged
he was
readying
himself
to go on foot
When
now
he met with
us
at
-
Assos
having taken in
him
we came
to
Mitylene
And from there
having sailed away
on the
following [day]
we arrived
opposite
Chios
-
then
the next [day]
we arrived
at
Samos
the
now
following [day]
we came
to
Miletus
Had decided
for
-
Paul
to sail by
-
Ephesus
so that
not
it might come upon
to him
to spend time
in
-
Asia
he was hastened
for
if
possible
it was
for him
on the
day
-
of Pentecost
to be
in
Jerusalem
From
then
-
Miletus
having sent
to
Ephesus
he called for
the
elders
of the
church
When
then
they had come
to
him
he said
to them
You
know
from
the first
day
on
which
I arrived
in
-
Asia
how
with
you
the
whole
time
I was
serving
the
Lord
with
all
humility
and
tears
and
trials
-
having befallen
me
in
the
plots
of the
Jews
how
nothing
I did shrink back
of that
being profitable
-
not
to declare
to you
and
to teach
you
publicly
and
from
house to house
earnestly testifying
to the Jewish
both
and
to Greeks
-
in
God
repentance
and
faith
in
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
And
now
behold
bound
I
in the
Spirit
go
to
Jerusalem
what
in
it
will happen
to me
not
knowing
except
that
the
Spirit
-
Holy
in every
city
fully testifies
to me
saying
that
chains
and
tribulations
me
await
But
not any
account
I make
my
life
dear
to myself
so as
to finish
the
course
of me
and
the
ministry
that
I received
from
the
Lord
Jesus
to testify fully
the
gospel
of the
grace
-
of God
And
now
behold
I
know
that
no more
you will see
the
face
of me
you
all
among
whom
I have gone about
proclaiming
the
kingdom
Therefore
I testify
to you
in
-
this
day
that
innocent
I [am]
of
the
blood
of all
not
for
I shrunk back
-
not
from declaring
all
the
counsel
-
of God
to you
Take heed
to yourselves
and
to all
the
flock
among
which
you
the
Spirit
-
Holy
has set
overseers
to shepherd
the
church
-
of God
which
He purchased
with
-
blood
the
own
I
know
that
will come in
after
the
departure
of me
wolves
grievous
among
you
not
sparing
the
flock
and
out from
your own
selves
will rise up
men
speaking
perverse things
-
to draw away
-
disciples
after
them
Therefore
stay awake
remembering
that
three years
night
and
day
not
I ceased
with
tears
admonishing
one
each
And
-
now
I commit
you
to
God
and
to the
word
of the
grace
of Him
-
being able
to build up
and
to give
you
an inheritance
among
those
having been sanctified
all
Silver
or
gold
or
clothing
of no one
I coveted
You yourselves
know
that
the
needs
of me
and
to those
being
with
me
ministered to
the
hands
these
In everything
I showed
you
that
by thus
straining
it behooves [us]
to aid
those
being weak
to remember
and also
the
words
of the
Lord
Jesus
how
He Himself
said
Blessed
it is
more
to give
than
to receive
And
these things
having said
having bowed
the
knee
of him
with
all
them
he prayed
Much
then
weeping
there was
among all
and
having fallen
upon
the
neck
-
of Paul
they were kissing
him
sorrowing
especially
over
the
word
that
he had spoken
that
no more
they are about
the
face
of him
to see
They accompanied
then
him
to
the
ship
After
then
it happened
sailing
our
having drawn away
from
them
having run directly
we came
to
-
Cos
-
and
the next [day]
to
-
Rhodes
and from there
to
Patara
And
having found
a boat
passing over
into
Phoenicia
having gone on board
we set sail
Having sighted
then
-
Cyprus
and
having left
it
on the left
we kept sailing
to
Syria
and
landed
at
Tyre
There
for
the
ship
was
unloading
the
cargo
Having sought out
then
the
disciples
we remained
there
days
seven
who
-
to Paul
kept telling
through
the
Spirit
not
to go up
to
Jerusalem
When
then
it happened that
had completed
we
the
days
having set out
we journeyed
accompanying
us
all
with
wives
and
children
as far as
outside
the
city
And
having bowed
the
knees
on
the
shore
having prayed
having said farewell
to one another
then
we went up
into
the
boat
they
then
returned
to
the
own
We
then
the
voyage
having completed
from
Tyre
came down
to
Ptolemais
and
having greeted
the
brothers
we stayed
day
one
with
them
On the
now
next day
having gone forth
we came
to
Caesarea
and
having entered
into
the
house
of Philip
the
evangelist
being
of
the
seven
we stayed
with
him
With this [man]
now
there were
daughters
four
virgins
prophesying
Remaining
now
days
many
came down
a certain one
from
-
Judea
a prophet
named
Agabus
and
having come
to
us
and
having taken
the
belt
-
of Paul
having bound
of himself
the
feet
and
the
hands
he said
Thus
says
the
Spirit
-
Holy
The
man
of whom
is
the
belt
this
in this way
will bind
in
Jerusalem
the
Jews
and
will deliver [him]
into
[the] hands
of [the] Gentiles
When
then
we had heard
these things
began begging
we
both
and
those
of that place
-
not
to go up
him
to
Jerusalem
Then
answered
-
Paul
What
are you doing
weeping
and
breaking
my
-
heart
I
for
not
only
to be bound
but
also
to die
at
Jerusalem
readiness
have
for
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Not
being persuaded
then
of him
we were silent
having said
Of the
Lord
the
will
be done
After
now
the
days
these
having packed the baggage
we started on our way up
to
Jerusalem
Went
then
also [some]
of the
disciples
from
Caesarea
with
us
bringing [one]
with
whom
we would lodge
Mnason
a certain
Cypriot
an early
disciple
Having arrived
now
we
at
Jerusalem
gladly
received
us
the
brothers
On the
now
following [day]
went in
-
Paul
with
us
unto
James
all
and
arrived
the
elders
And
having greeted
them
he began to relate
by
one
each
the things
had done
-
God
among
the
Gentiles
through
the
ministry
of him
Those
then
having heard
began glorifying
-
God
They said
then
to him
You see
brother
how many
myriads
there are
among
the
Jews
-
having believed
and
all
zealous ones
for the
law
are
They have been informed
now
about
you
that
apostasy
you teach
from
Moses
those
among
the
Gentiles
all
Jews
telling
not
to circumcise
them
the
children
nor
in the
customs
to walk
What
then
is it
Certainly
they will hear
that
you have come
This
therefore
do you
what
to you
we say
There are
with us
men
four
a vow
having
on
themselves
These [men]
having taken
be purified
with
them
and
bear expense
for
them
so that
they will shave
the
head
and
will know
all
that
of which
they have been informed
about
you
nothing
is
but
you walk orderly
also
yourself
keeping
the
law
Concerning
now
those
having believed
of the Gentiles
we
wrote
having adjudged
to keep from
them
the things
both
sacrificed to idols
and
blood
and
what is strangled
and
sexual immorality
Then
-
Paul
having taken
the
men
on the
following
day
with
them
having been purified
entered
into
the
temple
declaring
the
fulfillment
of the
days
of the
purification
until
that
was offered
for
one
each
of them
the
sacrifice
When
now
were about
the
seven
days
to be completed
the
from
-
Asia
Jews
having seen
him
in
the
temple
began stirring up
all
the
crowd
and
laid
upon
him
the
hands
crying out
Men
Israelites
help
This
is
the
man
who
against
the
people
and
the
law
and
the
place
this
all those
everywhere
teaching
besides
and
also
Greeks
he has brought
into
the
temple
and
defiled
the
holy
place
this
It was they
for
having previously seen
Trophimus
the
Ephesian
in
the
city
with
him
whom
they were supposing
that
into
the
temple
had brought
-
Paul
Was thrown into commotion
also
the
city
whole
and
there was
a rushing together
of the
people
And
having laid hold
-
of Paul
they dragged
him
outside
the
temple
and
immediately
were shut
the
doors
Of them seeking
then
him
to kill
there came
a report
to the
commander
of the
cohort
that
all
was in an uproar
Jerusalem
who
at once
having taken with [him]
soldiers
and
centurions
ran down
upon
them
-
And
having seen
the
commander
and
the
soldiers
they stopped
beating
-
Paul
Then
having drawn near
the
commander
laid hold
of him
and
commanded [him]
to be bound
with chains
two
and
began inquiring
who
he might be
and
what
it is
he has been doing
Others
however
another [or]
one thing
were crying out
in
the
crowd
Not
being able
now
he
to know
the
facts
on account of
the
uproar
he ordered
to be brought
him
into
the
barracks
When
now
he came
to
the
stairs
it happened that
was carried
he
by
the
soldiers
because of
the
violence
of the
crowd
Were following
for
the
multitude
of the
people
crying out
Away with
him
Being about
then
to be brought
into
the
barracks
-
Paul
says
to the
commander
If
is it permitted
to me
to say
something
to
you
-
Then
he was saying
Greek
do you know
Not
then
you
are
the
Egyptian
-
before
these
the
days
having led a revolt
and
having led out
into
the
wilderness
the
four thousand
men
of the
Assassins
Said
however
-
Paul
I
a man
indeed
am
a Jew
of Tarsus
-
of Cilicia
not [of an]
insignificant
city
a citizen
I implore
now
you
allow
me
to speak
to
the
people
Having allowed [him]
then
he
-
Paul
having stood
on
the
stairs
made a sign
with the
hand
to the
people
great
then
silence
having taken place
he spoke to [them]
in the
Hebrew
language
saying
Men
brothers
and
fathers
hear
of me
the
to
you
now
defense
Having heard
then
that
in the
Hebrew
language
he was addressing
them
even more
they became
quiet
And
he says
I
am
a man
a Jew
born
in
Tarsus
-
of Cilicia
brought up
now
in
the
city
this
at
the
feet
of Gamaliel
having been instructed
according to [the]
exactness
of the
of our Fathers
law
a zealous one
being
-
for God
even as
all
you
are
this day
who
this
-
Way
persecuted
as far as
death
binding
and
betraying
to
prisons
men
both
and
women
as
also
the
high priest
bears witness
to me
and
all
the
elderhood
from
whom
also
letters
having received
to
the
brothers
to
Damascus
I was on my way
to bring
also
those
there
being
bound
to
Jerusalem
in order that
they might be punished
It happened
however
to me
journeying
and
drawing near
-
to Damascus
about
noon
suddenly
out of
-
heaven
shone
a light
great
around
me
I fell
then
to
the
ground
and
heard
a voice
saying
to me
Saul
Saul
why
Me
persecute you
I
then
answered
Who
are You
Lord
He said
then
to
me
I
am
Jesus
of
Nazareth
whom
you
are persecuting
Those
then
with
me
being
the
indeed
light
beheld
the
however
voice
not
did they hear
of the [One]
speaking
to me
I said
then
What
shall I do
Lord
-
And
the Lord
said
to
me
Having risen up
go
to
Damascus
and there
you
it will be told
concerning
all things
that
it has been appointed
you
to do
While
now
not
I could see
from
the
brightness
of the
light
that
being led by the hand
by
those
being with
me
I came
to
Damascus
Ananias
then
certain
a man
devout
according to
the
law
borne witness to
by
all
the
dwelling [there]
Jews
having come
to
me
and
having stood by [me]
said
to me
Saul
brother
receive your sight
And I
the same
-
hour
looked up
at
him
-
And
he said
The
God
of the
fathers
of us
has appointed
you
to know
the
will
of Him
and
to see
the
Righteous One
and
to hear
[the] voice
out of
the
mouth
of Him
For
you will be
a witness
for Him
to
all
men
of what
you have seen
and
heard
And
now
why
delay you
Having arisen
be baptized
and
wash away
the
sins
of you
calling on
the
name
of Him
It happened
then
to me
having returned
to
Jerusalem
and
praying
of my
in
the
temple
fell
I
into
a trance
and
saw
Him
saying
to me
Make haste
and
go away
with
speed
out of
Jerusalem
because
not
they will receive
your
testimony
about
Me
And I
said
Lord
they themselves
know
that
I
was
imprisoning
and
beating
in each
of those
synagogues
those
believing
on
You
And
when
was poured out
the
blood
of Stephen
the
witness
of You
also
I myself
was
standing by
and
consenting
and
watching over
the
garments
of those
killing
him
And
He said
to
me
Go
for
I
to
[the] Gentiles
far away
will send
you
They were listening
now
to him
until
this
-
word
and
they lifted up
the
voice
of them
saying
Away with
from
the
earth
the
such
Not
for
it is fit
he
to live
Were crying out
then
they
and
casting off
the
garments
and
dust
throwing
into
the
air
Ordered
the
commander
to be brought
him
into
the
barracks
having directed
by flogging
to be examined
him
so that
he might know
for
what
cause
like this
they were crying out
against him
As
however
he stretched forward
him
with the
straps
said
to
the
standing by
centurion
-
Paul
If
a man
a Roman
and
uncondemned
it is lawful
to you
to flog
Having heard
then
the
centurion
having gone
to the
commander
he reported [it]
saying
What
are you going
to do
The
for
man
this
a Roman
is
Having come near
then
the
commander
said
to him
Tell
me
you
a Roman
are
-
And
he was saying
Yes
Answered
then
the
commander
I
with a great
sum
the
citizenship
this
bought
-
But
Paul
was saying
I
however
even
was born [so]
Immediately
therefore
departed
from
him
those
being about
him
to examine
and
the
commander
also
was afraid
having ascertained
that
a Roman
he is
and
because
him
he had
bound
On the
now
next day
desiring
to know
-
for certain
-
why
he is accused
by
the
Jews
he unbound
him
and
commanded
to assemble
the
chief priests
and
all
the
council
And
having brought down
-
Paul
he set [him]
among
them
Having looked intently
then
-
Paul
Council
he said
Men
brothers
I
in all
conscience
good
have lived as a citizen
-
to God
unto
this
-
day

-
Then
the high priest
Ananias
commanded
those
standing by
him
to strike
of him
the
mouth
Then
-
Paul
to
him
said
To strike
you
is about
-
God
wall
whitewashed
And
you
do you sit
judging
me
according to
the
law
and
violating law
command
me
to be struck
Those who
now
stood by
said
The
high priest
-
of God
do you insult
Was saying
then
-
Paul
Not
I was aware
brothers
that
he is
high priest
it has been written
for
-
[The] ruler
of the
people
of you
not
you shall speak
evil [of]
Having known
then
-
Paul
that
the
one
part
consists
of Sadducees
-
but
the other
of Pharisees
he began crying out
in
the
Council
Men
brothers
I
a Pharisee
am
[the] son
of a Pharisee
concerning
[the] hope
and
resurrection
of [the] dead
am judged
This
then
of him
saying
arose
a dissension
between the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
and
was divided
the
crowd
Sadducees
for
say
not
there to be
resurrection
nor
angel
nor
spirit
Pharisees
however
confess
-
both
Arose
then
a clamor
great
and
having risen up
some
of the
scribes
of the
party
of the
Pharisees
they were contending
saying
Nothing
evil
we find
in
the
man
this
What if
now
a spirit
has spoken
to him
or
an angel
Great
then
arising
dissension
having feared
the
commander
lest
should be torn to pieces
-
Paul
by
them
he commanded
the
troop
having gone down
to take by force
him
from
midst
of them
to bring [him]
then
into
the
barracks
-
But
the following
night
having stood by
him
the
Lord
said
Take courage
as
for
you have fully testified
-
about
Me
at
Jerusalem
so
you
it behooves
also
in
Rome
to testify
When it was
then
day
having made
a conspiracy
the
Jews
put under an oath
themselves
declaring
neither
to eat
nor
to drink
until
that
they should kill
-
Paul
There were
now
more than
forty
-
this
-
plot
having made
who
having come
to the
chief priests
and
the
elders
said
With an oath
we have bound
ourselves
nothing
to eat
until
that
we should kill
-
Paul
Now
therefore
you
make a report
to the
commander
along with
the
Council
so that
he might bring down
him
to
you
as
being about
to examine
more earnestly
the things
about
him
we
then
before
-
drawing near
his
ready
are
-
to kill
him
Having heard
however
the
son
of the
sister
of Paul
of the
ambush
having come near
and
having entered
into
the
barracks
he reported [it]
-
to Paul
Having called to [him]
then
-
Paul
one
of the
centurions
he was saying
The
young man
this
take
to
the
commander
he has
for
to report
something
to him
The [one]
indeed
therefore
having taken
him
brought [him]
to
the
commander
and
he says
The
prisoner
Paul
having called to
me
asked [me]
this
-
young man
to lead
to
you
having
something
to say
to you
Having taken hold
then
the
hand
of him
the
commander
and
having withdrawn
in
private
he began to inquire
What
is it
that
you have
to report
to me
He said
then
-
The
Jews
have agreed
-
to ask
you
that
tomorrow
-
Paul
you might bring down
into
the
Council
as
being about
something
more earnestly
to inquire
about
him
You
therefore
not
should be persuaded
by them
Lie in wait
indeed
for him
of
them
men
more than
forty
who
have put under an oath
themselves
neither
to eat
nor
to drink
until
that
they have killed
him
and
now
they are
ready
awaiting
the
from
you
promise
-
Indeed
therefore
the commander
dismissed
the
young man
having instructed [him]
No one
tell
that
these things
you have reported
to
me
And
having called to [him]
certain
two
of the
centurions
he said
Prepare
soldiers
two hundred
so that
they might go
as far as
Caesarea
and
horsemen
seventy
and
spearmen
two hundred
for
the third
hour
of the
night
Mounts
then
provide
so that
having set upon [them]
-
Paul
they might bring [him] safely
to
Felix
the
governor
having written
a letter
having
the
form
this
Claudius
Lysias
To the
most excellent
governor
Felix
Greetings
The
man
this
having been seized
by
the
Jews
and
being about
to be killed
by
them
having come up
with
the
troop
I rescued [him]
having learned
that
a Roman
he is
Resolving
then
to know
the
charge
on account of
which
they were accusing
him
I brought [him] down
to
the
council
of them
whom
I found
being accused
concerning
questions
of the
law
of them
no
however
worthy
of death
or
of chains
having
accusation
It having been disclosed
then
to me
of a plot that
against
the
man
would be
at once
I sent [him]
to
you
having instructed
also
the
accusers
to speak
against
him
before
you
-
Indeed
therefore
the soldiers
according to
that
having been ordered
them
having taken
-
Paul
brought [him]
by
night
to
-
Antipatris
On the
now
next day
having allowed
the
horsemen
to go
with
him
they returned
to
the
barracks
who
having entered
into
-
Caesarea
and
having delivered
the
letter
to the
governor
presented
also
-
Paul
to him
Having read [it]
then
and
having asked
from
what
province
he is
and
having learned
that
from
Cilicia [he is]
I will hear fully
you
he was saying
when
also
the
accusers
of you
may have arrived
having commanded
in
the
Praetorium
-
of Herod
to be guarded
him
After
then
five
days
came down
the
high priest
Ananias
with
elders
some
and
an orator
Tertullus
certain
who
made a representation
to the
governor
against
-
Paul
Having been called
then
of him
began
to accuse
-
Tertullus
saying
Great
peace
we are attaining
through
you
and
excellent measures
are being done
to the
nation
this
through
-
your
foresight
in every way
both
and
everywhere
we gladly accept [it]
most excellent
Felix
with
all
thankfulness
In order that
however
not
to
any longer
you
I should be a hindrance
I implore
to hear
you
us
briefly
[in]
your
kindness
Having found
for
the
man
this
a pest
and
stirring
insurrection
among all
the
Jews
-
in
the
world
a leader
then
of the
of the
Nazarenes
sect
who
even
the
temple
attempted
to profane
whom
also
we seized
From
him
you will be able
yourself
having examined [him]
concerning
all
these things
to know
of which
we
accuse
him
Agreed
then
also
the
Jews
declaring
these things
so
to be
Answered
then
-
Paul
having made a sign
to him
the
governor
to speak
For
many
years
as being
you
judge
to
nation
this
knowing
cheerfully
to the things
concerning
myself
I make a defense
Being able
you
to know
that
not
more than
there are
to me
days
twelve
from
which
I went up
to worship
in
Jerusalem
And
neither
in
the
temple
did they find
me
with
anyone
reasoning
or
a tumultuous gathering
making
of a crowd
nor
in
the
synagogues
nor
in
the
city
Nor
to prove
are they able
to you
concerning
[the things] of which
now
they accuse
me
I confess
however
this
to you
that
according to
the
Way
which
they call
a sect
so
I serve
the
of our fathers
God
believing
all things
-
throughout
the
law
and
that
in
the
Prophets
have been written
a hope
having
in
-
God
which
also
they
themselves
await
[that] a resurrection
there is about
to be
of [the] just
both
and
of [the] unjust
In
this
also
I myself
strive
without offense
a conscience
to have
toward
-
God
and
-
men
through
everything
After
years
now
many
alms
to bring
to
the
nation
of me
I arrived
and
offerings
during
which
they found
me
purified
in
the
temple
not
with
a crowd
nor
in
tumult
Some
however [are]
from
-
Asia
Jews
who
ought
before
you
to appear
and
to make accusation
if
anything
they may have
against
me
Otherwise
themselves
it
let them say
any
they found
unrighteousness
having stood
in me
before
the
Council
[other] than
concerning
one
this
voice
which
I cried out
among
them
standing
-
Concerning
[the] resurrection
of [the] dead
I
am judged
this day
by
you
Put off
however
them
-
Felix
more precisely
having knowledge of
the things
concerning
the
Way
having said
When
Lysias
the
commander
might have come down
I will examine
the things
as to
you
having commanded
the
centurion
to keep
him
to [let him] have
then
ease
and
not
to forbid
the
own
of him
to minister
to him
After
then
days
some
having arrived
-
Felix
with
Drusilla
the
own
wife
being
a Jewess
he sent for
-
Paul
and
heard
him
concerning
the
in
Christ
Jesus
faith
Reasoning
then
he
concerning
righteousness
and
self-control
and
the
judgment
-
coming
frightened
having become
-
Felix
answered
For the
present
being
go away
opportunity
then
having found
I will call for
you
At the same time
also
he is hoping
that
riches
will be given
him
by
-
Paul
Therefore
also
often
him
sending for
he was talking
with him
Two years
however
having been completed
received [as]
successor
-
Felix
Porcius
Festus
wishing
then
favor
to acquire for himself
with the
Jews
-
Felix
left
-
Paul
imprisoned
Festus
therefore
having arrived in
the
province
after
three
days
he went up
to
Jerusalem
from
Caesarea
Made a presentation before
then
him
the
chief priests
and
the
chiefs
of the
Jews
against
-
Paul
and
they were begging
him
asking
a favor
against
him
that
he would summon
him
to
Jerusalem
an ambush
forming
to kill
him
on
the
way
-
Indeed
therefore
Festus
answered that
is to be kept
-
Paul
in
Caesarea
he himself
now
is about
in
quickness
to set out
Those
therefore
among
you
he says
[those] in power
having gone down too
if
anything
there is
in
the
man
wrong
let them accuse
him
Having spent
then
with
them
days
not
more than
eight
or
ten
having gone down
to
Caesarea
on the
next day
having sat
on
the
judgment seat
he commanded
-
Paul
to be brought
Having arrived
then
he
stood around
him
the
from
Jerusalem
having come down
Jews
many
and
weighty
charges
bringing
which
not
they were able
to prove
-
Paul
made his defense
-
Neither
against
the
law
of the
Jews
nor
against
the
temple
nor
against
Caesar
[in] anything
have I sinned
-
Festus
however
wishing
on the
Jews
a favor
to lay
answering
-
Paul
said
Are you willing
to
Jerusalem
having gone up
there
concerning
these things
to be judged
before
me
Said
then
-
Paul
Standing
before
the
judgment seat
of Caesar
I am
where
me
it behooves
to be judged
To [the] Jews
nothing
I have done wrong
as
also
you
very well
know
If
indeed
therefore
I do wrong
and
worthy
of death
have done
anything
not
I do refuse
-
to die
If
however
nothing
there is
of which
they
[can] accuse
me
no one
me
can
to them
give up
To Caesar
I appeal
Then
-
Festus
having conferred
with
the
Council
answered
To Caesar
You have appealed
to
Caesar
you will go
Days
now
having passed
some
Agrippa
the
king
and
Bernice
came down
to
Caesarea
greeting
-
Festus
As
now
many
days
they stayed
there
-
Festus
the
king
laid before
the things
relating to
-
Paul
saying
A man
certain
there is
left
by
Felix
[as] a prisoner
concerning
whom
having been
my
in
Jerusalem
made a presentation
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
Jews
asking
against
him
judgment
to
whom
I answered
that
not
it is
[the] custom
with Romans
to give up
any
man
before
that
the [one]
being accused
to
face
may have [it]
the
accusers
[the] opportunity
and
of defense
he may have
concerning
the
accusation
Having come together
therefore
here
delay
no
having made
the
next [day]
having sat
on
the
judgment seat
I commanded
to be brought
the
man
concerning
whom
having stood up
the
accusers
no
charge
were bringing
of which
I
was expecting
crimes
Questions
however
certain
concerning
the
own
religion
they had
against
him
and
concerning
a certain
Jesus
having been dead
whom
was affirming
-
Paul
to be alive
Being perplexed
now
I
-
concerning
this
inquiry
was asking
if
he was willing
to go
to
Jerusalem
and there
to be judged
concerning
these things
-
But
of Paul
having appealed for
to be kept
himself
for
the
-
Emperor's
decision
I commanded
to be kept
him
until
that
I might send
him
to
Caesar
Agrippa
then
[said] to
-
Festus
I have been wanting
also
myself
the
man
to hear
Tomorrow
he says
you will hear
him
On the
therefore
next day
having come
-
Agrippa
and
-
Bernice
with
great
pomp
and
having entered
into
the
audience hall
with
both
[the] commanders
and
men
-
in
prominence
in the
city
and
having commanded
-
Festus
was brought in
-
Paul
And
says
-
Festus
Agrippa
King
and
all
the
being present with
us
men
you see
this one
concerning
whom
all
the
multitude
of the
Jews
pleaded
with me
in
both
Jerusalem
and
here
crying out [that]
not
he ought
of him
to live
no longer
I
however
having understood
nothing
worthy
him
of death
to have done
himself
and
of this one
having appealed to
the
Emperor
I determined
to send [him]
concerning
whom
definite
anything
to write
to
[my] lord
not
I have
Therefore
I have brought
him
before
you all
and
especially
before
you
King
Agrippa
so that
the
examination
having taken place
I might have
something
to write
Absurd
for
to me
it seems
[in] sending
a prisoner
not
also
the
against
him
charges
to specify
Agrippa
then
to
-
Paul
was saying
It is permitted
you
for
yourself
to speak
Then
-
Paul
having stretched out
the
hand
began his defense
Concerning
all
of which
I am accused
by
[the] Jews
King
Agrippa
I esteem
myself
fortunate
before
you
being about
today
to defend myself
Especially
acquainted
being
you
with all
the
of
[the] Jews
customs
and
also
controversies
therefore
I implore [you]
patiently
to hear
me
The
indeed
then
manner of life
of me
from
youth
-
from [its]
beginning
having been
among
the
nation
of me
in
also
Jerusalem
know
all
Jews
knowing
me
from the first
if
they would be willing
to testify
that
according to
the
strictest
sect
-
of our
religion
I lived [as]
a Pharisee
And
now
for [the]
hope
of the
to
the
fathers
of us
promise
having been made
by
-
God
I stand
being judged
to
which
the
twelve tribes
of us
in
earnestness
night
and
day
serving
hope
to attain
concerning
which
hope
I am accused
by
the Jews
O king
Why
incredible
is it judged
by
you
if
-
God
[the] dead
raises
I
indeed
therefore
thought
in myself
to
the
name
of Jesus
-
of Nazareth
I ought
many things
contrary
to do
which
also
I did
in
Jerusalem
and
many
also
of the
saints
I
in
prisons
locked up
the
from
the
chief priests
authority
having received
being put to death
then
they
I cast against [them]
a vote
And
in
all
the
synagogues
often
punishing
them
I was compelling [them]
to blaspheme
Exceedingly
then
being furious
against them
I kept persecuting [them]
as far as
even
to
-
foreign
cities
during
which
journeying
to
-
Damascus
with
[the] authority
and
commission
of
the
chief priests
day
mid
on
the
road
I saw
O king
from heaven
above
the
brightness
of the
sun
having shone around
me
a light
and
those
with
me
journeying
All
and
having fallen down
of us
to
the
ground
I heard
a voice
saying
to
me
in the
Hebrew
language
Saul
Saul
why
Me
persecute you
[It is] hard
for you
against
[the] goads
to kick
I
then
said
Who
are You
Lord
-
And
the Lord
said
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are persecuting
But
rise up
and
stand
on
the
feet
of you
for this
purpose
for
I have appeared
to you
to appoint
you
a servant
and
a witness
of that which
both
you have seen
of Me
of the things in which
then
I will appear
to you
delivering
you
out from
the
people
and
from
the
Gentiles
to
whom
I
am sending
you
to open
eyes
of them
that
they may turn
from
darkness
to
light
and
from the
power
-
of Satan
to
-
God
[that]
may receive
they
forgiveness
of sins
and
[an] inheritance
among
those
having been sanctified
by faith
that [is]
in
Me
So then
O king
Agrippa
not
I was
disobedient
to the
heavenly
vision
but
to those
in
Damascus
first
both
and
Jerusalem
all
and
the
region
-
of Judea
and
to the
Gentiles
I kept declaring
to repent
and
to turn
to
-
God
worthy
-
of repentance
works
doing
On account of
these things
me
the Jews
having seized
in
the
temple
they were attempting
to kill
Help
therefore
having obtained
-
from
-
God
unto
the
day
this
I have stood
bearing witness
to small
both
and
to great
nothing
other
saying
than what
both
the
prophets
said
was about
to happen
and
Moses
that
would suffer
the
Christ
as
first
through
resurrection
from [the] dead
light
He is about
to preach
to
both
our people
and
to the
Gentiles
These things
now
of him
saying in his defense
-
Festus
in a loud
-
voice
said
You are insane
Paul
The
great
of you
learning
to
insanity
turns [you]
-
But
Paul
Not
I am insane
says
most excellent
Festus
but
of truth
and
sobriety
words
I utter
Understands
for
concerning
these things
the
king
to
whom
also
using boldness
I speak
Are hidden from
for
him
of these things
not
I am persuaded
none
not
for
is
in
a corner
done
of these things
Believe you
King
Agrippa
the
prophets
I know
that
you believe
-
Then
Agrippa
[said] to
-
Paul
Within
so little
me
do you persuade
a Christian
to become
-
And
Paul [said]
I would wish
-
-
to God
both
in
a little
and
in
much
not
only
you
but
also
all
those
hearing
me
this day
to become
such
as
also
I
am
except
the
chains
these
Rose up
then
the
king
and
the
governor
-
and
Bernice
and
those
sitting with
them
and
having withdrawn
they began speaking
to
one another
saying
-
Nothing
of death
or
of chains
worthy
is doing
the
man
this
Agrippa
then
to
Festus
was saying
Have been released
could
the
man
this
if
not
he had appealed
to Caesar
When
now
was determined
-
sailing
our
to
-
Italy
they delivered
-
both
Paul
and
certain
other
prisoners
to a centurion
named
Julius
of the cohort
of Augustus
Having boarded
then
a ship
of Adramyttium
being about
to sail
to
the
along
-
Asia
places
we set sail
being
with
us
Aristarchus
a Macedonian
of Thessalonica
The
then
next [day]
we landed
at
Sidon
Considerately
then
-
Julius
-
Paul
having treated
allowed [him]
to
his
friends
having gone
care
to receive
And from there
having set sail
we sailed under
-
Cyprus
because of
-
the
winds
being
contrary
-
And
then
-
along
-
Cilicia
and
Pamphylia
having sailed across [the sea]
we came
to
Myra
-
of Lycia
And there
having found
the
centurion
a ship
of Alexandria
sailing
to
-
Italy
he placed
us
into
it
For
many
now
days
sailing slowly
and
with difficulty
having arrived
off
-
Cnidus
not
permitting
us
the
wind
we sailed under
-
Crete
off
Salmone
With difficulty
and
coasting along
it
we came
to
a place
certain
called
Fair
Havens
to which
near
was
[the] city
of Lasea
Much
now
time
having passed
and
being
already
dangerous
the
voyage
because of
-
even
the
Fast
already
being over
was admonishing [them]
-
Paul
saying
to them
Men
I understand
that
with
disaster
and
much
loss
not
only
of the
cargo
and
of the
ship
but
also
the
lives
of us
is about
to be
the
voyage
-
But
the centurion
by the
pilot
and
the
ship owner
rather
was persuaded
than
by the things
by
Paul
spoken
Unsuitable
now
the
harbor
being
to
winter in
the
majority
reached
a decision
to set sail
from there
if
somehow
they might be able
having arrived
at
Phoenix
to winter [there]
a harbor
-
of Crete
looking
toward
[the] southwest
and
toward
[the] northwest
Having blown gently
now
a south wind
having thought
the
purpose
to have obtained
having weighed [anchor]
very near
they began coasting along
-
Crete
After
not
long
however
there came
down
from it
a wind
tempestuous
-
called
the Northeaster
Having been caught
then
the
ship
and
not
being able
to face
to the
wind
having given way
we were driven along
An Island
then
certain
having run under
called
Cauda
we were able
with difficulty
control
to gain
of the
lifeboat
which
having taken up
supports
they began using
undergirding
the
ship
Fearing
then
lest
into
the
sandbars of Syrtis
they should fall
having lowered
the
gear
thus
they were driven along
Violently
now
being storm-tossed
of us
on the
next [day]
a jettison of cargo
they began to make
and
on the
third [day]
with [their] own hands
the
tackle
of the
ship
they cast away
Neither
now
sun
nor
stars
appearing
for
many
days
tempest
and
no
small
lying on [us]
from then on
was abandoned
hope
all
-
being saved
of us
Much
also
time without food
there being
at that time
having stood up
-
Paul
in
midst
of them
he said
It behooved [you]
indeed
O
men
having been obedient
to me
not
to have set sail
from
-
Crete
to have incurred
then
the
disaster
this
and
-
loss
And yet
-
now
I exhort
you
to keep up your courage
loss
for
of life
none
there will be
from among
you
only
of the
ship
Stood by
for
me
this
-
night
-
of God
whose
am
whom
and
I serve
an angel
saying
Not
fear
Paul
Caesar
you
it behooves
to stand before
And
behold
has granted
to you
-
God
all
those
sailing
with
you
Therefore
take courage
men
I believe
for
-
God
that
thus
it will be
according to
the
way
it has been said
to me
Upon
an island
however
certain
it behooves
us
to fall
When
then
the fourteenth
night
had come
being driven about
of us
in
the
Adriatic
toward
[the] middle
of the
night
began sensing
the
sailors
to be drawing near
some
to them
land
And
having taken soundings
they found
fathoms
twenty
A little
then
having gone farther
and
again
having taken soundings
they found
fathoms
fifteen
Fearing
then
lest
somewhere
on
rocky
places
we might fall
out of [the]
stern
having cast
anchors
four
they were praying for
day
to come
Of the
then
sailors
seeking
to flee
out of
the
ship
and
having let down
the
lifeboat
into
the
sea
under pretense
as
from
[the] bow
anchors
being about
to cast out
said
-
Paul
to the
centurion
and
to the
soldiers
If
not
these
remain
in
the
ship
you
to be saved
not
are able
Then
cut away
the
soldiers
the
ropes
of the
lifeboat
and
allowed
her
to fall away
Until
then
that
day
was about
to come
kept urging
-
Paul
all
to partake
of food
saying
The fourteenth
today
[is] day
watching
without eating
you continue
nothing
having taken
Therefore
I exhort
you
to take
food
this
indeed
for
-
of you
preservation
is
not one
for
of you
a hair
of
the
head
will perish
Having said
now
these things
and
having taken
bread
he gave thanks
-
to God
before
all
and
having broken [it]
he began
to eat
Encouraged
then
having been
all
also
themselves
took
food
We were
then
the
altogether
souls
in
the
ship
two hundred
seventy
six
Having been filled
then
with food
they began to lighten
the
ship
casting out
the
wheat
into
the
sea
When
now
day
it was
the
land
not
they did recognize
a bay
however
certain
they noticed
having
a shore
on
which
they determined
if
they should be able
to drive
the
ship
And
the
anchors
having cut away
they left [them]
in
the
sea
at the same time
having loosened
the
ropes
of the
rudders
And
having hoisted
the
foresail
to the
blowing [wind]
they began making
for
the
shore
Having fallen
however
into
a place
between two seas
they ran aground
the
vessel
and
the
indeed
bow
having stuck fast
it remained
immovable
-
and
the stern
was being broken up
by
the
violence
Of the
now
soldiers
[the] plan
was
that
the
prisoners
they should kill
lest
anyone
having swum away
should escape
-
But
the centurion
desiring
to save
-
Paul
hindered
them
of
[the] purpose
he commanded
then
those
being able
to swim
having cast [themselves] off
first
on
the
land
to go out
and
the
rest
some
indeed
on
boards
some
then
on
things
-
from
the
ship
And
thus
it came to pass that
all
were brought safely
to
the
land
And
having been saved
then
we found out
that
Malta
the
island
is called
-
And
the natives
were showing
not [just]
the
ordinary
kindness
to us
Having kindled
for
a fire
they received
all
of us
because of
the
rain
-
coming on
and
because
of the
cold
Having gathered
now
-
Paul
of sticks
a
quantity
and
having laid [them]
on
the
fire
a viper
out from
the
heat
having come
fastened
on the
hand
of him
When
then
saw
the
natives
hanging
the
beast
from
the
hand
of him
to
one another
they began to say
By all means
a murderer
is
the
man
this
whom
having been saved
from
the
sea
-
Justice
to live
not
has permitted
The [one]
indeed
then
having shaken off
the
creature
into
the
fire
he suffered
no
injury
-
But
they were expecting
him
to be about
to become inflamed
or
to fall down
suddenly
dead
A while
great
however
of them
waiting
and
seeing
nothing
amiss
to
him
happening
having changed their opinion
they began declaring
him
to be
a god
In
now
the [parts]
around
the
place
that
were
lands
belonging to the
chief
of the
island
named
Publius
who
having received
us
days
three
hospitably
entertained [us]
It came to pass
then
the
father
-
of Publius
fevers
and
dysentery
oppressed with
was lying
toward
whom
-
Paul
having entered
and
having prayed
having laid
the
hands
on him
healed
him
Of this
then
having taken place
also
the
rest
-
in
the
island
having
infirmities
were coming
and
were healed
who
also
with many
honors
honored
us
and
on setting sail
they laid on [us]
the things
for
the
needs
After
then
three
months
we sailed
in
a ship
having wintered
in
the
island
Alexandrian
with a figurehead of
the Dioscuri
And
having put in
at
Syracuse
we stayed
days
three
from where
having gone around
we arrived
at
Rhegium
And
after
one
day
having come on
a south wind
on the second day
we came
to
Puteoli
where
having found
[some] brothers
we were entreated
with
them
to remain
days
seven
And
so
to
-
Rome
we came
And from there
the
brothers
having heard
the things
concerning
us
came out
to
meet
us
as far as
of Appius
[the] market
and
[the] Three
Taverns
whom
having seen
-
Paul
having given thanks
to
God
took
courage
When
now
we came
to
Rome
was allowed
-
Paul
to stay
by
himself
with
the
guarding
him
soldier
It came to pass
then
after
days
three
called together
he
those
being
of the
Jews
leaders
Having come together
then
of them
he was saying
to
them
I
men
brothers
nothing
against
having done
the
people
or
the
customs
-
of our fathers
a prisoner
from
Jerusalem
was delivered
into
the
hands
of the
Romans
who
having examined
me
were wanting
to let [me] go
on account of
-
not one
cause
of death
existing
in
me
Objecting
however
of the
Jews
I was compelled
to appeal to
Caesar
not
as
the
nation
of me
having
anything
to lay against
For
this
therefore
-
cause
I have called
you
to see
and
to speak to [you]
because of
for
the
hope
-
of Israel
the
chain
this
I have around [me]
-
And
to
him
they said
We
neither
letters
concerning
you
received
from
-
Judea
nor
having arrived
any
of the
brothers
reported
or
said
anything
concerning
you
evil
We deem it worthy
however
from
you
to hear
what
you think
concerning
truly
for
the
sect
this
known
to us
it is
that
everywhere
it is spoken against
Having appointed
then
him
a day
came
to
him
to
the
lodging
many
to whom
he expounded
fully testifying
to the
kingdom
-
of God
persuading
then
them
concerning
-
Jesus
from
both
the
law
of Moses
and
the
Prophets
from
morning
to
evening
And
some
indeed
were persuaded of
the things
he is speaking
some
however
refused to believe
Discordant
then
being
with
one another
they began to leave
having spoken
-
Paul
word
one
-
Rightly
the
Spirit
-
Holy
spoke
by
Isaiah
the
prophet
to
the
fathers
of you
saying
Go
to
the
people
this
and
say
In hearing
you will hear
and
no
not
understand
and
in seeing
you will see
and
no
not
perceive
Has grown dull
for
the
heart
of the
people
this
and
with the
ears
barely
they hear
and
the
eyes
of them
they have closed
lest
ever
they should see
with the
eyes
and
with the
ears
they should hear
and
with the
heart
they should understand
and
should turn
and
I will heal
them
Known
therefore
be it
to you
that
to the
Gentiles
has been sent
this
-
salvation
-
of God
they
then
will listen
He stayed
then
two years
whole
in
his own
rented house
and
was welcoming
all
-
coming
unto
him
proclaiming
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
teaching
the things
concerning
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
with
all
boldness
unhinderedly
Paul
a servant
of Christ
Jesus
a called
apostle
having been set apart
for
[the] gospel
of God
which
He promised beforehand
through
the
prophets
of Him
in
[the] Scriptures
Holy
concerning
the
Son
of Him
-
having come
of [the]
seed
of David
according to
flesh
-
having been declared
Son
of God
in
power
according to [the]
Spirit
of holiness
by
resurrection
[from the] dead
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
through
whom
we have received
grace
and
apostleship
unto
obedience
of faith
among
all
the
Gentiles
on behalf of
the
name
of Him
among
whom
are
also
you
called
of Jesus
Christ
To all
those
being
in
Rome
beloved
of God
called
saints
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
[the] Father
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
First
indeed
I thank
the
God
of me
through
Jesus
Christ
for
all
of you
because
the
faith
of you
is being proclaimed
in
all
the
world
Witness
for
my
is
-
God
whom
I serve
in
the
spirit
of me
in
the
gospel
of the
Son
of Him
how
unceasingly
mention
of you
I make
always
upon
the
prayers
of me
imploring
if
perhaps
now
at last
I will make a prosperous journey
by
the
will
-
of God
to come
to
you
I long
for
to see
you
that
some
I may impart
gift
to you
spiritual
to
the
strengthening
of you
that
now
is
to be encouraged together
among
you
through
the
among
one another
faith
of you
both
and
of me
Not
I do want
now
you
to be ignorant
brothers
that
many times
I purposed
to come
to
you
and
was hindered
until
the
present
that
some
fruit
I might have
also
among
you
as
even
among
the
other
Gentiles
To Greeks
both
and
to barbarians
to [the] wise
both
and
[the] foolish
a debtor
I am
Thus
-
as to
me [there is]
readiness
also
to you
who [are]
in
Rome
to preach the gospel
Not
for
I am ashamed of
the
gospel
[the] power
for
of God
it is
unto
salvation
to everyone
-
believing
to Jewish
both
first
and
to Greek
[The] righteousness
for
of God
in
it
is revealed
from
faith
to
faith
as
it has been written
-
And
the righteous
by
faith
will live
Is revealed
for
[the] wrath
of God
from
heaven
upon
all
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of men
-
the
truth
by
unrighteousness
suppressing
because
the
known
-
of God
manifest
is
among
them
-
God
for
to them
has revealed [it]
The
for
invisible qualities
of Him
from
[the] creation
of [the] world
by the
things made
being understood
are clearly seen
the
both
eternal
of Him
power
and
divinity
for
-
to be
them
without excuse
For
having known
-
God
not
as
God
they glorified [Him]
or
were thankful
but
they became futile
in
the
thinking
of them
and
was darkened
the
foolish
of them
heart
Professing
to be
wise
they became fools
and
they changed
the
glory
of the
immortal
God
into
a likeness
of an image
of mortal
man
and
birds
and
quadrupeds
and
creeping things
Therefore
gave up
them
-
God
in
the
desires
of the
hearts
of them
to
impurity
-
to dishonor
the
bodies
of them
between
themselves
who
changed
the
truth
-
of God
into
the
falsehood
and
reverenced
and
served
the
created thing
beyond
the [One]
having created [it]
who
is
blessed
to
the
ages
Amen
Because of
this
gave up
them
-
God
to
passions
of dishonor
-
Even
for
females
of them
changed
the
natural
use
into
that
contrary to
nature
Likewise
then
also
the
males
having left
the
natural
use
of the
female
were inflamed
in
the
desire
of them
toward
one another
males
with
males
the
shame
working out
and
the
recompense
which
was fitting
of the
error
of them
in
themselves
receiving
And
as
not
they did see fit
-
God
to have
in [their]
knowledge
gave up
them
-
God
to
a depraved
mind
to do
things
not
being proper
being filled with
all
unrighteousness
wickedness
covetousness
malice
full
of envy
murder
strife
deceit
maliciousness
gossips
slanderers
hateful to God
insolent
arrogant
boastful
inventors
of evil things
to parents
disobedient
foolish
untrustworthy
heartless
unmerciful
who
the
righteous decree
-
of God
having known
that
those
such
things
doing
worthy
of death
are
not
only
them
are practicing
but
also
are approving of
those
practicing [them]
Therefore
inexcusable
you are
O
man
each one
who
is judging
In
that which
for
you judge
the
other
yourself
you are condemning
-
for
the same things
you do
the [one]
judging
We know
however
that
the
judgment
-
of God
is
according to
truth
upon
those
-
such things
practicing
Suppose you
now
this
O
man
the [one]
judging
those
-
such things
practicing
and
doing
them [yourself]
that
you
will escape
the
judgment
-
of God
Or
the
riches
of the
kindness
of Him
and
the
forbearance
and
the
patience
despise you
not knowing
that
the
kindness
-
of God
to
repentance
you
leads
Because of
however
the
hardness
of you
and
unrepentant
heart
you are treasuring up
to yourself
wrath
in
[the] day
of wrath
and
revelation
of righteous judgement
-
of God
who
will give
to each
according to
the
works
of him
to those who
indeed
with
endurance
in work
good
glory
and
honor
and
immortality
are seeking
life
eternal
to those
however
of
self-interest
and
disobeying
the
truth
being persuaded about
however
-
unrighteousness
wrath
and
anger
tribulation
and
distress
upon
every
soul
of man
-
working
-
evil
of Jewish
both
first
and also
of Greek
glory
however
and
honor
and
peace
to everyone
-
doing
-
good
to Jewish
both
first
and
to Greek
Not
for
there is
partiality
with
-
God
As many as
for
without [the] Law
have sinned
without [the] Law
also
will perish
and
as many as
in
[the] Law
have sinned
by
[the] Law
will be judged
not
for
the
hearers
of [the] law [are]
righteous
with
-
God
but
the
doers
of [the] law
will be justified
When
for
Gentiles
-
not
the law
having
by nature
the things
of the
law
do
these
[the] Law
not
having
to themselves
are
a law
who
show
the
work
of the
law
written
in
the
hearts
of them
bearing witness
their
-
conscience
and
between
one another
the
thoughts
accusing
or
also
defending [them]
on
[that]
day
will judge
-
God
the
secrets
-
of men
according to
the
gospel
of me
by
Christ
Jesus
If
however
you
a Jew
are called
and
rely on
[the] law
and
boast
in
God
and
know
the
will
and
approve
the things
being superior
being instructed
out of
the
law
are persuaded [that]
then
you yourself
a guide
are
of [the] blind
a light
to those
in
darkness
an instructor
of [the] foolish
a teacher
of infants
having
the
embodiment
-
of knowledge
and
of the
truth
in
the
law
[you]
then
teaching
another
yourself
not
do you teach
You
preaching
not
to steal
do you steal
You
saying
not
to commit adultery
do you commit adultery
You
abhorring
-
idols
do you rob temples
You who
in
law
boast
through
the
transgression
of the
law
-
God
dishonor you
-
For
[The] name
-
of God
through
you
is blasphemed
among
the
Gentiles
as
it has been written
Circumcision
indeed
-
profits
if
[the] law
you do
if
however
a transgressor
of law
you are
the
circumcision
of you
uncircumcision
has become
If
therefore
the
uncircumcision
the
requirements
of the
law
keeps
not
the
uncircumcision
of him
for
circumcision
will be reckoned
And
will judge
the
by
nature
uncircumcision
the
law
fulfilling
you
who
with
[the] letter
and
circumcision
[are] a transgressor
of law
Not
for
the [one]
on
the
outward
a Jew
is
neither
the [one]
outwardly
the
outward
in
flesh
[is] circumcision
but
he who [is]
on
the
inward
a Jew [is one]
and
circumcision [is]
of heart
in
spirit
not
in letter
of whom
the
praise
[is] not
of
men
but
of
-
God
What
then [is]
the
superiority
of the
Jew
Or
what [is]
the
benefit
of the
circumcision
Much
in
every
way
Chiefly
indeed
for
that
they were entrusted with
the
oracles
-
of God
What
for
if
disbelieved
some
Not
the
unbelief
of them
the
faithfulness
-
of God
will nullify
Never
may it be
Let be
however
-
God
true
every
now
man
a liar
as
it has been written
That
-
You may be justified
in
the
words
of You
and
will prevail
in
-
being judged
Your
If
however
the
unrighteousness
of us
Godâs
righteousness
shows
what
shall we say
[Is]
unrighteous
-
God
-
inflicting
the
wrath
According to
man
I speak
Never
may it be
Otherwise
how
will judge
-
God
the
world
If
however
the
truth
-
of God
in
-
my
lie
abounded
to
the
glory
of Him
why
still
also I
as
a sinner
am judged
And [is it]
not
as
we are slanderously charged
and
as
affirm
some [that]
us
to say
-
Let us do
things
evil
that
may come
the
good things
Their
-
condemnation
just
is
What
then
Are we better
Not
at all
We have already charged
for
Jews
both
and
Greeks
all
under
sin
to be
As
it has been written
-
None
there is
righteous
not even
one
none
there is
-
understanding
none
there is
-
seeking after
-
God
All
have turned away
together they
have become worthless
none
there is
who
is practicing
good
not
there is
so much as
one
A grave
having been opened
the
throat
of them [is]
with the
tongues
of them
they keep practicing deceit
[the] venom
of vipers
[is] under
the
lips
of them
of whom
the
mouth
of cursing
and
of bitterness
is full
swift [are]
the
feet
of them
to shed
blood
ruin
and
misery
[are] in
the
paths
of them
and
[the] way
of peace
not
they have known
Not
there is
fear
of God
before
the
eyes
of them
We know
now
that
whatever
the
law
says
to those
under
the
law
it speaks
so that
every
mouth
may be stopped
and
under judgment
may be
all
the
world
-
to God
Therefore
by
works
of [the] Law
not
will be justified
any
flesh
before
Him
through
for
[the] Law
[is] knowledge
of sin
Now
however
apart from
law
[the] righteousness
of God
has been revealed
being borne witness to
by
the
Law
and
the
Prophets
[the] righteousness
now
of God
through
faith
from Jesus
Christ
toward
all
those
believing
Not
for
there is
distinction
All
for
have sinned
and
fall short
of the
glory
-
of God
being justified
freely
by the
of Him
grace
through
the
redemption
that
[is] in
Christ
Jesus
whom
set forth as
-
God
a propitiation
through
faith
in
-
His
blood
for
a showing forth
of the
righteousness
of Him
because of
the
forbearance
of the
having taken place beforehand
sins
in
the
forbearance
-
of God
for
of
[the] showing forth
the
righteousness
of Him
in
the
present
time
for
-
to be
Him
just
and
justifying
the [one]
of
faith
of Jesus
Where
then [is]
the
boasting
It has been excluded
Through
what
principle
That
of works
No
but
through
[the] principle
of faith
We reckon
therefore
to be justified
by faith
a man
apart from
works
of the Law
Or
of Jews
[is He] the
God
only
not
also
of Gentiles
Yes
also
of Gentiles
since indeed
One
-
God [is]
who
will justify
[the] circumcision
by
faith
and
[the] uncircumcision
through
the [same]
faith
Law
then
do we nullify
through
-
faith
Never
may it be
Instead
law
we uphold
What
then
shall we say
discovered
Abraham
the
father
of us
according to
[the] flesh
If
for
Abraham
by
works
was justified
he has
ground of boasting
but
not
toward
God
What
for
the
Scripture
says
Believed
then
Abraham
-
God
and
it was reckoned
to him
for
righteousness
To the [one]
now
working
the
reward
not
is reckoned
according to
grace
but
according to
debt
To the [one]
however
not
working
believing
however
on
the [One]
justifying
the
ungodly
is reckoned
the
faith
of him
for
righteousness
just as
also
David
declares
the
blessedness
of the
man
to whom
-
God
credits
righteousness
apart from
works
Blessed
[are they] of whom
are forgiven
the
lawless deeds
and
of whom
are covered
the
sins
blessed
[the] man
against whom
no
not
will reckon
[the] Lord
sin
[Is] the
blessing
then
this
on
the
circumcision
or
also
on
the
uncircumcision
We are saying
for
was credited
-
to Abraham
the
faith
as
righteousness
How
then
was it credited
In
circumcision
being
or
in
uncircumcision
Not
in
circumcision
but
in
uncircumcision
And
[the] sign
he received
of circumcision
a seal
of the
righteousness
of the
faith
that [he had]
[while] in
the
uncircumcision
for
the
to be
him
father
of all
those
believing
in
uncircumcision
for
-
to be credited
to them
the
righteousness
and
father
of circumcision
to those
not
of
circumcision
only
but
also
to those
walking
in the
steps
of the
during
uncircumcision
faith
of the
father
of us
Abraham
Not
for
through
[the] Law
the
promise [was]
-
to Abraham
or
the
descendants
of him
that
heir
he
should be
[of the] world
but
through
[the] righteousness
of faith
If
for
those
of
[the] Law [are]
heirs
has been made void
-
faith
and
made of no effect
the
promise
-
For
law
wrath
brings
where
now
no
there is
law
neither [is]
transgression
Therefore
it [is]
of
faith
that [it may be]
according to
grace
for
-
to be
sure
the
promise
to all
the
seed
not
to that
of
the
law
only
but
also
to that
of [the]
faith
of Abraham
who
is
[the] father
of all
of us
as
it has been written
-
A father
of many
nations
I have made
you
before
whom
he believed
God
the [One]
giving life
to the
dead
and
calling
the things
not
[into] being
even
existing
who
against
hope
in
hope
believed
for
-
to become
him
[the] father
of many
nations
according to
that
having been spoken
So
shall be
the
offspring
of you
And
not
having become weak
in the
faith
he considered
-
of himself
the body
having become dead
a hundred years old
about
being
and
the
lifelessness
of the
womb
of Sarah
At
however
the
promise
-
of God
not
he did waver
-
through unbelief
but
was strengthened
-
in faith
having given
glory
-
to God
and
having been fully assured
that
what
He had promised
able
He is
also
to do
Therefore
also
it was credited
to him
unto
righteousness
Not
it was written
now
on account of
him
alone
that
it was credited
to him
but
also
on account of
us
to whom
it is about
to be credited
to those
believing
on
the [One]
having raised
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
out from
[the] dead
who
was delivered over
for
the
trespasses
of us
and
was raised
for
the
justification
of us
Having been justified
therefore
by
faith
peace
we have
with
-
God
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
also
-
access
we have
by the
faith
into
the
grace
this
in
which
we stand
and
we boast
in
hope
of the
glory
-
of God
Not
only [so]
now
but
also
we glory
in
-
tribulations
knowing
that
-
tribulation
perseverance
produces
-
And
perseverance
character
-
and
character
hope
-
And
hope
not
does make [us] ashamed
because
the
love
-
of God
has been poured out
into
the
hearts
of us
through
[the] Spirit
Holy
the [One]
having been given
to us
Yet
indeed
Christ
being
of us
without strength
still
according to
[the] right time
for
[the] ungodly
died
Rarely
indeed
for
a righteous [man]
anyone
will die
on behalf of
though
the
good [man]
perhaps
someone
even
would dare
to die
Demonstrates
however
the
of Himself
love
to
us
-
God
that
still
sinners
being
of us
Christ
for
us
died
Much
therefore
more
having been justified
now
by
the
blood
of Him
we will be saved
by
Him
from
the
wrath
If
for
enemies
being
we were reconciled
-
to God
through
the
death
of the
Son
of Him
much
more
having been reconciled
shall we be saved
in
the
life
of Him
Not
only [so]
now
but
also
we are rejoicing
in
-
God
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
now
the
reconciliation
we have received
Because of
this
just as
through
one
man
-
sin
into
the
world
entered
and
through
-
sin
-
death
also
thus
to
all
men
-
death
passed
for
that
all
sinned
Until
for
[the] law
sin
was
in [the]
world
sin
however
not
is imputed
not
there being
law
Nevertheless
reigned
-
death
from
Adam
until
Moses
even
over
those
not
having sinned
in
the
likeness
of the
transgression
of Adam
who
is
a type
of the
coming [One]
But
[is] not
like
the
trespass
so
also
the
gift
If
for
by the
of the
one
trespass
the
many
died
how much
more
the
grace
-
of God
and
the
gift
in
grace
which [is]
of the
one
man
Jesus
Christ
to
the
many
did abound
And
[is] not
as
through
one
having sinned
the
gift
The
truly
for
judgment [was]
of
one
[was] unto
condemnation
-
but
the gift
[is] out of
many
trespasses
unto
justification
If
for
by the
of the
one
trespass
-
death
reigned
through
the
one
how much
more
those
the
abundance
-
of grace
and
of the
gift
-
of righteousness
receiving
in
life
will reign
through
the
one
Jesus
Christ
So
then
just as
by
one
trespass
to
all
men
[it is] unto
condemnation
so
also
by
one
act of righteousness
to
all
men
[it is] unto
justification
of life
For as
for
through
the
disobedience
of the
one
man
sinners
were made
the
many
so
also
through
the
obedience
of the
One
righteous
will be made
the
many
[The] law
now
entered
so that
might abound
the
trespass
where
however
abounded
-
sin
overabounded
-
grace
so that
just as
reigned
the
sin
in
-
death
so
also
-
grace
might reign
through
righteousness
unto
life
eternal
through
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
What
then
will we say
Shall we continue
-
in sin
that
-
grace
may abound
Never
may it be
Who
we died
-
to sin
how
still
shall we live
in
it
Or
are you unaware
that
as many as
have been baptized
into
Christ
Jesus
into
the
death
of Him
have been baptized
We were buried
therefore
with Him
through
-
baptism
into
-
death
so that
just as
was raised up
Christ
out from
[the] dead
by
the
glory
of the
Father
so
also
we
in
newness
of life
should walk
If
for
united
we have become
in the
likeness
of the
death
of Him
certainly
also
of the
resurrection
we will be
this
knowing
that
-
old
of us
self
was crucified with [Him]
so that
might be annulled
the
body
-
of sin
[that]
no longer
are enslaved
we
-
to sin
The [one]
for
having died
has been freed
from
-
sin
If
now
we died
with
Christ
we believe
that
also
we will live with
Him
knowing
that
Christ
having been raised up
out from
[the] dead
no more
dies
Death
Him
no longer
rules over
That which
for
He died
-
to sin
He died
once for all
that which
however
He lives
He lives
-
to God
So
also
you
consider
yourselves
to be
dead
indeed
-
to sin
living
however
-
to God
in
Christ
Jesus
Not
therefore
let reign
-
sin
in
the
mortal
of you
body
in order
-
to obey
the
desires
of it
Neither
yield
the
members
of you
[as] instruments
of unrighteousness
-
to sin
but
yield
yourselves
-
to God
as
out from
[the] dead
living
and
the
members
of you
[as] instruments
of righteousness
-
to God
Sin
for
you
not
will rule over
not
for
you are
under
law
but
under
grace
What
then
Shall we sin
because
not
we are
under
law
but
under
grace
Never
may it be
Not
know you
that
to whom
you yield
yourselves
[as] slaves
for
obedience
slaves
you are
to him whom
you obey
whether
of sin
to
death
or
of obedience
to
righteousness
Thanks [be]
however
-
to God
that
you used to be
slaves
-
of sin
you have become obedient
now
from [the]
heart
to
which
you were handed over
to the form
of teaching
Having been set free
now
from
-
sin
you have become slaves
-
to righteousness
In human terms
I speak
on account of
the
weakness
of the
flesh
of you
For as
for
you yielded
the
members
of you
in bondage
-
to impurity
and
to
lawlessness
unto
-
lawlessness
so
now
yield
the
members
of you
in bondage
-
to righteousness
unto
sanctification
When
for
slaves
you were
-
of sin
free
you were
-
from righteousness
What
therefore
fruit
had you
then
in the [things]
of which
now
you are ashamed
The
for
end
of those things
[is] death
Now
however
having been set free
from
-
sin
having become slaves
now
-
to God
you have
the
fruit
of you
unto
sanctification
-
now
the end
[is] life
eternal
The
for
wages
-
of sin
[is] death
-
but
the gift
-
of God
life
eternal
in
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
Or
are you ignorant
brothers
to those knowing
for
law
I speak
that
the
law
rules over
the
man
for
as long as
[the] time
he is alive
The
for
married
woman
to the
living
husband
is bound
by law
if
however
should die
the
husband
she is cleared
from
the
law
of the
husband
Then
therefore
being alive
the
husband
an adulteress
she will be called
if
she is
to man
another
if
however
should die
the
husband
free
she is
from
the
law
[so as for]
not
to be
her
an adulteress
having been
to man
another
Likewise
brothers
of me
also
you
have been put to death
to the
law
through
the
body
-
of Christ
for
-
to belong
you
to another
to the [One]
out from
[the] dead
having been raised
so that
we should bear fruit
-
to God
While
for
we were
in
the
flesh
the
passions
-
of sins
that [were]
through
the
law
were at work
in
the
members
of us
to
the
bringing forth of fruit
-
to death
Now
however
we have been released
from
the
law
having died
to
that which
we were bound
in order for
to serve
us
in
newness
of [the] Spirit
and
not
in oldness
of [the] letter
What
then
shall we say
[Is] the
law
sin
Never
may it be
But
-
sin
not
I have known
if
not
by
law
-
then
for
covetousness
not
I had been conscious of
if
not
the
law
had said
Not
you shall covet
An occasion
however
having taken
-
sin
by
the
commandment
it produced
in
me
all
covetousness
apart from
for
[the] Law
sin
[is] dead
I
however
was alive
apart from
law
once
having come
however
the
commandment
the
sin
revived
I
then
died
And
proved to be
me
the
commandment
that [was]
to
life
this
to
death
The
for
sin
an occasion
having taken
by
the
commandment
deceived
me
and
by
it
put [me] to death
So
-
indeed
the law [is]
holy
and
the
commandment [is]
holy
and
righteous
and
good
That which
then
[is] good
to me
has become
death
Never
may it be
But
-
sin
in order that
it might be shown to be
sin
through
that which [is]
good
to me
is working out
death
so that
might become
beyond
excess
sinful
-
sin
through
the
commandment
We know
for
that
-
[the] Law
spiritual
is
I
however
fleshly
am
having been sold
under
-
sin
What
for
I do
not
I understand
not
for
what
I want
this
I do
but
what
I hate
this
I do
If
now
that which
not
I do want
this
I do
I consent
to the
law
that [it is]
good
In that case
now
no longer
I
am doing
it
but
the
dwelling
in
me
sin
I know
for
that
nothing
there dwells
in
me
that
is
in
the
flesh
of me
good
-
for
to will
is present with
me
-
but
to do
the
good
not
Not
for
that
I desire
I do
good
but
that
not
I do want
evil
this
I practice
If
now
what
not
I do want
I
this
do
[it is] no longer
I
who do
it
but
-
dwelling
in
me
sin
I find
so
the
principle
that
desiring
me
to do
-
good
that
me
-
evil
is present with
I delight
for
in the
law
-
of God
according to
the
inward
man
I see
however
another
law
in
the
members
of me
warring against
the
law
of the
mind
of me
and
making captive
me
to
the
law
-
of sin
-
being
in
the
members
of me
O wretched
I am
man
Who
me
will deliver
out of
the
body
-
of death
this
Thanks [be]
to
God
through
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
Then
so
myself
I
with the
indeed
mind
serve
law
Godâs
-
but [with]
the flesh
[the] law
of sin
[There is] no
therefore
now
condemnation
to those
in
Christ
Jesus
-
For
the law
of the
Spirit
of
life
in
Christ
Jesus
has set free
you
from
the
law
-
of sin
and
-
of death
-
For
powerless [being]
the
law
in
that
it was weak
through
the
flesh
-
God
-
of Himself
Son
having sent
in
likeness
of flesh
of sin
and
for
sin
condemned
-
sin
in
the
flesh
so that
the
righteousness
of the
law
should be fulfilled
in
us
-
not
according to
the flesh
walking
but
according to
[the] Spirit
Those
for
according to
flesh
being
the things
of the
flesh
mind
those
however
according to
Spirit
the things
of the
Spirit
The
for
mind
of the
flesh
[is] death
the
but
mind
of the
Spirit
life
and
peace
because
the
mind
of the
flesh
[is] hostility
toward
God
to
for
[the] law
-
of God
not
it is subject
nor even
for
can it [be]
Those
now
in
flesh
being
God
to please
not
are able
You
now
not
are
in
flesh
but
in
Spirit
if indeed [the]
Spirit
of God
dwells
in
you
if
however
anyone
[the] Spirit
of Christ
not
has
he
not
is
of Him
If
however
Christ
[is] in
you
the
indeed
body [is]
dead
on account of
sin
the
however
Spirit
[is] life
on account of
righteousness
If
now
the
Spirit
of the [One]
having raised up
-
Jesus
out from
[the] dead
dwells
in
you
the [One]
having raised up
out from
[the] dead
Christ
Jesus
will give life
also
to the
mortal
bodies
of you
on account of
-
dwelling
His
Spirit
in
you
So
then
brothers
debtors
we are
not
to the
flesh
-
according to
flesh
to live
If
for
according to
flesh
you live
you are about
to die
if
however
by [the] Spirit
the
deeds
of the
body
you put to death
you will live
As many as
for
by [the] Spirit
of God
are led
these
sons
are
of God
Not
for
you have received
a spirit
of bondage
again
to
fear
but
you have received
[the] Spirit
of divine adoption as sons
by
whom
we cry
Abba
-
Father
Himself
the
Spirit
bears witness with
the
spirit
of us
that
we are
children
of God
If
now
children
also
heirs
heirs
indeed
of God
joint-heirs
now
of Christ
if indeed
we suffer with [Him]
so that
also
we may be glorified together
I reckon
for
that
not
comparable
the
sufferings
of the
present
time [are]
to
the
coming
glory
to be revealed
to
us
The
for
earnest expectation
of the
creation
the
revelation
of the
sons
-
of God
awaits
To the
for
futility
the
creation
was subjected
not
willingly
but
because of
the [One]
having subjected [it]
in
hope
that
also
itself
the
creation
will be set free
from
the
bondage
-
of decay
into
the
freedom
of the
glory
of the
children
-
of God
We know
for
that
all
the
creation
groans together
and
travails together
until
-
now
Not
only [so]
now
but
even
ourselves
the
firstfruit
of the
Spirit
having
we
also
ourselves
in
ourselves
groan
divine adoption as sons
awaiting
the
redemption
of the
body
of us
In this
for
hope
we were saved
hope
however
being seen
not
is
hope
what
for
sees
any
one
does he hope for
If
however
what
not
we see
we hope for
in
patience
we await
Likewise
now
also
the
Spirit
joins to help
the
weakness
of us
the
for
things which
we should pray for
as
it behooves
not
we know
but
Himself
the
Spirit
makes intercession
with groanings
inexpressible
The [One]
now
searching
-
hearts
knows
what [is]
the
mindset
of the
Spirit
because
according to
God
He intercedes
for
[the] saints
We know
now
that
to those
loving
-
God
all things
works together
for
good
to those
according to
[His] purpose
called
being
For
those whom
He foreknew
also
He predestined [to be]
conformed to
the
image
of the
Son
of Him
for
-
to be
Him
firstborn
among
many
brothers
Those whom
then
He predestined
these
also
He called
and
whom
He called
these
also
He justified
whom
then
He justified
these
also
He glorified
What
then
will we say
to
these things
If
-
God [is]
for
us
who [can be]
against
us
He who
indeed
the
own
Son
not
spared
but
for
us
all
gave up
Him
how
not
also
with
Him
things
all
us
will He grant
Who
will bring an accusation
against
[the] elect
of God
God [is]
the [One]
justifying
Who [is]
the [one]
condemning
[For it is] Christ
Jesus
the [one]
having died
rather
now
having been raised up
who
is
at [the]
right hand
-
of God
who
and
is interceding
for
us
Who
us
will separate
from
the
love
-
of Christ
Tribulation
or
distress
or
persecution
or
famine
or
nakedness
or
danger
or
sword
As
it has been written
-
For the sake
of you
we face death
all
the
day
we were regarded
as
sheep
of slaughter
But
in
these things
all
we more than conquer
through
the [One]
having loved
us
I am persuaded
for
that
neither
death
nor
life
nor
angels
nor
principalities
nor
things present
nor
things to come
nor
powers
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
any
created thing
other
will be able
us
to separate
from
the
love
-
of God
-
in
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
[The] truth
I speak
in
Christ
Not
I am lying
bearing witness with
me
the
conscience
of me
in [the]
Spirit
Holy
that
grief
to me
is
great
and
unceasing
sorrow
in the
heart
of me
Could wish
for
a curse
to be
myself
I
separated from
-
Christ
for
the
brothers
of me
-
kinsmen
of me
according to
[the] flesh
who
are
Israelites
whose [is]
the
divine adoption as sons
and
the
glory
and
the
covenants
and
the
lawgiving
and
the
service
and
the
promises
whose [are]
the
patriarchs
and
from
whom [is]
-
Christ
-
according to
the flesh
-
being
over
all
God
blessed
to
the
ages
Amen
[It is] not
as
however
that
has failed
the
word
-
of God
Not
for
all
who [are]
of
Israel
[are] these
Israel
Nor
because
they are
seed
of Abraham
[are] all
children
rather
In
Isaac
will be named
to you
offspring
That
is
not
the
children
of the
flesh
these [are]
children
-
of God
but
the
children
of the
promise
are regarded
as
offspring
Of [the] promise
for
the
word
[is] this
At
the
time
this
I will come
and
there will be
-
to Sarah
a son
Not
only
then
but
also
Rebecca
by
one
conception
having
Isaac
the
father
of us
not yet
for
having been born
nor
having done
anything
good
or
evil
so that
the
according to
election
purpose
-
of God
might stand
not
of
works
but
of
the [One]
calling
it was said
to her
-
The
older
will serve
the
younger
As
it has been written
-
Jacob
I loved
-
but
Esau
I hated
What
then
shall we say
Not
injustice
with
-
God [is there]
Never
may it be
To
Moses
for
He says
I will show mercy to
whom
-
I may show mercy
and
I will have compassion on
whom
-
I may have compassion
So
then
[it is] not
of the
willing
nor
of the
running
but
-
showing mercy
of God
Says
for
the
Scripture
to
Pharaoh
-
For
this very
therefore
I have raised up
you
so that
I might show
in
you
the
power
of Me
and
that
should be declared
the
name
of Me
in
all
the
earth
So
then
to whom
He wants
He shows mercy
whom
now
He wants
He hardens
You will say
to me
then
Why
still
does He find fault
The
for
purpose
of Him
who
is resisting
O
man
but rather
you
who
are
-
answering against
-
God
Not
will say
the
thing formed
to the [One]
having formed [it]
Why
me
have you made
like this
Or
not
has
authority
the
potter
over the
clay
out of
the
same
lump
to make
one
indeed
unto
honor
vessel
one
however
unto
dishonor
What if
now
desiring
-
God
to show
the
wrath
and
to make known
the
power
of Him
bore
with
much
patience
[the] vessels
of wrath
having been fitted
for
destruction
also
that
He might make known
the
riches
of the
glory
of Him
upon
[the] vessels
of mercy
which
He prepared beforehand
for
glory
whom
even
He has called
us
not
only
out from
[the] Jews
but
also
out from
[the] Gentiles
As
also
in
-
Hosea
He says
I will call
that which [is]
not
people
of Me
people
of Me
and
her
not
having been loved
having been loved
and
It will happen that
in
the
place
where
it was said
to them
Not
people
My [are]
You
there
they will be called
sons
of God
[the] living
Isaiah
also
cries out
concerning
-
Israel
Though
shall be
the
number
of the
sons
of Israel
as
the
sand
of the
sea
[only] the
remnant
will be saved
[The] sentence
for
concluding
and
bringing swiftly
will perform [the]
Lord
upon
the
earth
And
as
foretold
Isaiah
If
not
[the] Lord
of Hosts
had left
us
descendants
like
Sodom
-
we would have become
and
like
Gomorrah
-
we would have been made
What
then
will we say
That
Gentiles
-
not
pursuing
righteousness
have attained
righteousness
righteousness
now
that [is]
by
faith
Israel
however
pursuing
a law
of righteousness
to
[that] law
not
did attain
Because of
why
Because [it was]
not
by
faith
but
as
by
works
They stumbled
over the
stone
-
of stumbling
as
it has been written
Behold
I lay
in
Zion
a stone
of stumbling
and
a rock
of offense
and
the [one]
believing
on
Him
never
will be put to shame
Brothers
the
indeed
desire
-
of my
heart
and
the
supplication
to
-
God
on behalf of
them
[is] for
salvation
I bear witness
for
about them
that
zeal
for God
they have
but
not
according to
knowledge
Being ignorant of
for
the
-
of God
righteousness
and
the
own
seeking
to establish
to the
righteousness
-
of God
not
they submitted
[The] end
for
of law
[is] Christ
unto
righteousness
to everyone
-
believing
Moses
for
writes
-
[of] the
righteousness
that [is]
of
law
The
having done
man
will live
by
them
The
however
of
faith
righteousness
thus
speaks
Not
you should say
in
the
heart
of you
Who
will ascend
into
-
heaven
that
is
Christ
to bring down
or
Who
will descend
into
the
abyss
that
is
Christ
out from
[the] dead
to bring up
But
what
says it
Near
you
the
word
is
in
the
mouth
of you
and
in
the
heart
of you
That
is
the
word
-
of faith
which
we proclaim
that
if
you confess
with
the
mouth
of you
[The] Lord [is]
Jesus
and
believe
in
the
heart
of you
that
-
God
Him
raised
out from
[the] dead
you will be saved
In the heart
for
is belief
unto
righteousness
in the mouth
now
is confession
unto
salvation
Says
for
the
Scripture
Everyone
-
believing
on
Him
not
will be put to shame
Not
for
there is
difference
Jew
between
and
Greek
-
for
the same
Lord
of all
is rich
toward
all
those
calling
Him
Whoever
for
that
-
shall call upon
the
name
of [the] Lord
will be saved
How
then
shall they call
on [Him]
whom
not
they believed
How
now
shall they believe on [Him]
of whom
not
they have heard
How
now
shall they hear
apart from
preaching
How
now
shall they preach
if
not
they are sent
As
it has been written
How
beautiful
the
feet
of those
proclaiming good news
good things
But
not
all
heeded
the
good news
Isaiah
for
says
Lord
who
has believed
the
report
of us
So
-
faith [is]
from
hearing
-
and
hearing
through
[the] word
of Christ
But
I ask
no
not
did they hear
Indeed
Into
all
the
earth
has gone out
the
voice
of them
and
to
the
ends
of the
world
the
words
of them
But
I ask
not
Israel
not
did know
First
Moses
says
I
will provoke to jealousy
you
by [those]
not
a nation
by
a nation
without understanding
I will anger
you
Isaiah
then
is very bold
and
says
I was found
those
Me
not
seeking
manifest
I became
to those
Me
not
inquiring after
As for
however
-
Israel
he says
All
the
day
I have stretched out
the
hands
of Me
to
a people
disobeying
and
contradicting
I ask
then
not
did reject
-
God
the
people
of Him
Never
may it be
Also
for
I
an Israelite
am
of [the]
seed
of Abraham
of [the] tribe
of Benjamin
Not
did reject
-
God
the
people
of Him
whom
He foreknew
Or
not
know you
in
Elijah
what
says
the
Scripture
how
he pleads
-
with God
against
-
Israel
Lord
the
prophets
of You
they have killed
the
altars
of You
they have torn down
and I
have been left
alone
and
they are seeking
the
life
of me
But
what [was]
spoken
to him
the
divine answer
I have left
to Myself
seven thousand
men
who
not
have bowed
[the] knee
-
to Baal
Thus
then
also
in
the
present
time
a remnant
according to
[the] election
of grace
there has been
If
now
by grace
no longer
from
works
otherwise
-
grace
no longer
would be
grace
What
then
What
is seeking
Israel
this
not
it has obtained
-
but
the elect
obtained [it]
The
now
rest
were hardened
as
it has been written
Gave
them
-
God
a spirit
of stupor
eyes
-
not
to see
and
ears
-
not
to hear
unto
the
today
day
And
David
says
Let be
the
table
of them
for
a snare
and
for
a trap
and
for
a stumbling block
and
for
a retribution
to them
let be darkened
the
eyes
of them
-
not
to see
and
the
backs
of them
for
ever
bent over
I ask
then
not
did they stumble
that
they might fall
Never
may it be
But
in the
of them
trespass
-
[is] salvation
to the
Gentiles
so as
-
to provoke to jealousy
them
If
however
the
trespass
of them
[is] riches
of [the] world
and
the
failure
of them
[is the] riches
of [the] Gentiles
how much
more
the
fullness
of them
To you
now
I am speaking
the
Gentiles
Upon
as much as
indeed
therefore
am
I
of [the] Gentiles
apostle
the
ministry
of me
I magnify
if
at all
I shall provoke to jealousy
of me
the
flesh
and
shall save
some
of
them
If
for
the
rejection
of them
[is the] reconciliation
of [the] world
what [will be]
the
acceptance
if
not
life
out from
[the] dead
If
now
the
firstfruit
[is] holy
also
the
lump
and
if
the
root
[is] holy
also
the
branches
If
however
some
of the
branches
were broken off
you
now
a wild olive tree
being
were grafted in
among
them
and
a fellow-partaker
of the
root
of the
fatness
of the
olive tree
have become
not
boast over
the
branches
If
now
you boast against [them]
not
you
the
root
support
but
the
root
you
You will say
then
Were broken off
branches
that
I
might be grafted in
Rightly so
by the
unbelief
they were broken off
you
however
-
by faith
stand
Not
high
be minded
but
be afraid
If
for
-
God
the
according to
nature
branches
not
spared
neither
you
will He spare
Behold
therefore
[the] kindness
and
severity
of God
upon
indeed
those
having fallen
severity
toward
however
you
kindness
of God
if
you continue in
the
kindness
otherwise
also
you
will be cut off
Even they
now
if
not
they continue
-
in unbelief
will be grafted in
able
for
is
-
God
again
to graft in
them
If
for
you
out of
the
according to
nature
were cut off
a wild olive tree
and
contrary to
nature
were grafted
into
a cultivated olive tree
how much
more
these
who
according to
nature [are]
will be grafted into
the
own
olive tree
Not
for
I want
you
to be ignorant
brothers
of the
mystery
this
that
not
you may be
in
yourselves
wise
that
a hardening
in
part
-
to Israel
has happened
until
that
the
fullness
of the
Gentiles
may come in
and
so
all
Israel
will be saved
as
it has been written
Will come
out of
Zion
the [One]
Delivering
He will remove
ungodliness
from
Jacob
And
this [is]
to them
the
from
Me
covenant
when
I shall take away
the
sins
of them
As regards
indeed
the
gospel
[they are] enemies
on account of
you
As regards
however
the
election
beloved
on account of
the
patriarchs
Irrevocable
for
[are] the
gifts
and
the
calling
-
of God
Just as
for
you
once
were disobedient
-
to God
now
however
have been shown mercy
the
of these
disobedience
so
also
these
now
have been disobedient
the
for your
mercy
so that
also
they
now
may have mercy shown [them]
Has bound up
for
-
God
-
all
in
disobedience
that
-
all
He may show mercy to
O
[the] depth
of riches
both
of wisdom
and
knowledge
of God
How
unsearchable
the
judgments
of Him
and
untraceable
the
ways
of Him
Who
for
has known
[the] mind
of [the] Lord
or
who
counselor
of Him
has been
Or
who
has first given
to Him
and
it will be recompensed
to him
For
from
Him
and
through
Him
and
unto
Him
-
[are] all things
To Him [be]
the
glory
to
the
ages
Amen
I exhort
therefore
you
brothers
through
the
compassions
-
of God
to present
the
bodies
of you
a sacrifice
living
holy
-
to God
well-pleasing
which is
[the] reasonable
service
of you
And
not
be conformed
to the
age
this
but
be transformed
by the
renewing
of the
mind
for
-
to prove
by you
what [is]
the
will
-
of God
-
good
and
well-pleasing
and
perfect
I say
for
through
the
grace
-
having been given
to me
to everyone
-
being
among
you
not
to be high-minded
above
what
it behooves [you]
to think
but
to think
so as
-
to be sober-minded
to each
as
-
God
has allotted
a measure
of faith
Just as
for
in
one
body
many
members
we have
-
now
the members
all
not
the
same
have
function
so
the
many
one
body
we are
in
Christ
-
and
individually
one
of another
members
We are having
however
gifts
according to
the
grace
-
having been given
to us
different
if
prophecy
according to
the
proportion
of the
faith
or
service
in
the
service
or
-
teaching
in
the
teaching
or
-
exhorting
in
the
exhortation
-
giving
in
generosity
-
leading
with
diligence
-
showing mercy
with
cheerfulness
[Let]
love [be]
unfeigned
abhorring
-
evil
cleaving to
-
good
-
in brotherly love
to
one another
devoted
-
in honor
one another
esteeming
-
in diligence
not
lagging
-
in spirit
being fervent
the
Lord
serving
-
in hope
rejoicing
-
in tribulation
being patient
-
in prayer
being constant
to the
needs
of the
saints
contributing
-
hospitality
pursuing
Bless
those
persecuting
Bless
and
not
curse
to rejoice
with the
rejoicing
to weep
with the
weeping
the
same thing
toward
one another
minding
not
the things
haughty
minding
but
with the
lowly
going along
Not
be
wise
in
yourselves
To no one
evil
for
evil
repaying
providing
right
before
all
men
if
possible
-
of
you
with
all
men
living at peace
never
yourselves
avenging
beloved
instead
give
place
-
to wrath
it has been written
for
Mine [is]
vengeance
I
will repay
says [the]
Lord
On the contrary
If
should hunger
the
enemy
of you
feed
him
if
he should thirst
give drink
him
this
for
doing
coals
of fire
you will heap
upon
the
head
of him
Not
be overcome
by
-
evil
but
overcome
with
-
good
-
evil
Every
soul
to the authorities
being above [him]
let be subject
Not
for
there is
authority
if
not
by
God
those
however
existing
by
God
having been instituted
are
Therefore
the [one]
resisting
the
authority
the
-
of God
ordinance
has resisted
those
now
having resisted
upon themselves
judgment
will bring
The
for
rulers
not
are
a terror
-
to good
works
but
-
to evil
Do you desire
now
not
to fear
the
authority
The
good
do
and
you will have
praise
from
him
Of God
for
servant
he is
to you
for
-
good
If
however
-
evil
you do
be afraid
not
for
in vain
the
sword
he bears
of God
for
a servant
He is
an avenger
for
wrath
to the [one]
-
evil
doing
Therefore
necessary [it is]
to be subject
not
only
on account of
the
wrath
but
also
on account of
the
conscience
Because of
this
for
also
taxes
pay you
servants
for
of God
they are
upon
this very
thing
attending continually
Render
to all
their
dues
to whom
the
tax
the
tax
to whom
the
revenue
the
revenue
to whom
the
respect
the
respect
to whom
the
honor
the
honor
To no one
nothing
owe
if
not
-
one another
to love
the [one]
for
loving
the
other
[the] Law
has fulfilled
-
For
Not
you shall commit adultery
Not
you shall murder
Not
you shall steal
Not
you shall covet
and
if
any
other
commandment
in
the
word
this
it is summed up
in
the [saying]
You shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
-
Love
to the
neighbor
evil
not
does do
[the] fulfillment
therefore
of [the] law
-
love [is]
And
this
knowing
the
time
that [it is the]
hour
already
for you
out of
sleep
to awaken
now
for
nearer
[is] of us
the
salvation
than
when first
we believed
The
night
is nearly over
-
and
the day
has drawn near
We should cast off
therefore
the
works
-
of darkness
we should put on
now
the
armor
-
of light
As
in
daytime
properly
we should walk
not
in reveling
and
drinking
not
in sexual immorality
and
sensuality
not
in dissension
and
jealousy
But
put on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
of the
flesh
provision
not
make
for
desires
The [one]
now
being weak
in the
faith
receive
not
for
passing judgment
on reasonings
One
indeed
believes
to eat
all things
the [one]
however
being weak
vegetables
eats
The [one]
eating
the [one]
not
eating
not
let him despise
the [one]
now
not
eating
him
eating
not
let him judge
-
God
for
him
has received
You
who
are
-
judging
anotherâs
servant
To the
own
master
he stands
or
falls
He will be upheld
however
able is
for
the
Lord
to uphold
him
One
truly
for
judges
a day
[to be] above
[another] day
one
however
judges
every
day [alike]
Each
in
the
own
mind
let be fully assured
The [one]
regarding
the
day
to [the] Lord
regards [it]
does observe
the [one]
eating
to [the] Lord
eats
he gives thanks
for
-
to God
and
the [one]
not
eating
to [the] Lord
not
he eats
and
he gives thanks
-
to God
No one
for
of us
to himself
lives
and
no one
to himself
dies
If
both
for
we should live
to the
Lord
we live
if
also
we should die
to the
Lord
we die
If
both
therefore
we should live
if
also
we should die
the
Lordâs
we are
Unto
this
for
Christ
died
and
lived again
that
both [the]
dead
and
living
He might rule over
You
however
why
judge you
the
brother
or you
or
also
you
why
do despise
the
brother
of you
All
for
we will stand before
the
judgment seat
of
God
It has been written
for
Live
I
says
[the] Lord
that
to Me
will bow
every
knee
and
every
tongue
will confess
-
to God
So
then
each
of us
concerning
himself
account
will give
-
to God
No longer
therefore
one another
should we judge
but
this
determine
rather
-
not
to put
[any] stumbling block
before [your]
brother
or
snare
I know
and
I am persuaded
in [the]
Lord
Jesus
that
nothing [is]
unclean
of
itself
if
not
to him
reckoning
anything
unclean
to be
to that one
unclean [it is]
If
for
on account of
food
the
brother
of you
is grieved
no longer
according to
love
are you walking
Not
with the
food
of you
that one
destroy
for
whom
Christ
died
Not
let be spoken of as evil
therefore
your
-
good
Not
for
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
eating
and
drinking
but
righteousness
and
peace
and
joy
in [the]
Spirit
Holy
The [one]
for
in
these things
serving
-
Christ
[is] well-pleasing
-
to God
and
approved
-
by men
So
then
the things
-
of peace
we should pursue
and
the things
-
for edification
-
among
each other
Not
for the sake of
food
destroy
the
work
-
of God
All things
indeed [are]
clean
but
[it is] wrong
to the
man
-
through
a stumbling block
eating
[It is] good
-
neither
to eat
meat
nor
to drink
wine
nor [anything]
in
which
the
brother
of you
stumbles
You
[the] faith
that
have
to
yourself
keep
before
-
God
Blessed [is]
the [one]
not
judging
himself
in
what
he approves
The [one]
however
doubting
if
he eats
has been condemned
because [it is]
not
of
faith
everything
now
that [is]
not
of
faith
sin
is
We ought
now
we
who [are]
strong
the
weaknesses
of the
weak
to bear
and
not
ourselves
to please
Each
of us
the
neighbor
let please
unto
the
good
for
edification
Even
for
-
Christ
not
Himself
pleased
but
as
it has been written
The
reproaches
of those
reproaching
You
have fallen
on
Me
Whatever
for
was written in the past
for
-
our
instruction
was written
so that
through
-
endurance
and
through
the
encouragement
of the
Scriptures
-
hope
we might have
The
now
God
-
of endurance
and
-
encouragement
may He give
you
the
same
to be of mind
with
one another
according to
Christ
Jesus
so that
with one accord
with
one
mouth
you may glorify
the
God
and
Father
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
receive
one another
as
also
-
Christ
received
you
to
[the] glory
-
of God
I say
for
Christ
a servant
to have become
of [the] circumcision
for
[the] truth
of God
in order
-
to confirm
the
promises given
to the
fathers
-
and [for]
the Gentiles
for
mercy
to glorify
-
God
as
it has been written
Because of
this
I will praise
You
among
[the] Gentiles
and
to the
name
of You
will I sing
And
again
it says
Rejoice you
Gentiles
with
the
people
of Him
And
again
Praise
all
the
Gentiles
the
Lord
and
praise
Him
all
the
peoples
And
again
Isaiah
says
There will be
the
root
-
of Jesse
and
the [One]
arising
to rule over
Gentiles
in
Him
[the] Gentiles
will hope
-
And
the God
-
of hope
may fill
you
with all
joy
and
peace
in
-
believing
for
-
to abound
you
in
-
hope
in
[the] power
[of the] Spirit
Holy
I am persuaded
now
brothers
of me
also
myself
I
concerning
you
that
also
you yourselves
full
are
of goodness
being filled
with all
-
knowledge
being able
also
one another
to admonish
More boldly
however
I have written
to you
in
part
as
reminding
you
because of
the
grace
-
having been given
to me
by
-
God
for
-
to be
me
a minister
Christ
of Jesus
to
the
Gentiles
administering the sacred service
of the
gospel
-
of God
so that
might become
the
offering
of the
Gentiles
acceptable
having been sanctified
in [the]
Spirit
Holy
I have
therefore
the
boasting
in
Christ
Jesus
in the things
pertaining to
-
God
Not
for
will I dare
anything
to speak of
what
except
has accomplished
Christ
through
me
unto [the]
obedience
of [the] Gentiles
by word
and
deed
in [the]
power
of signs
and
wonders
in [the]
power
of [the] Spirit
of God
so as
for me
from
Jerusalem
and
around
unto
-
Illyricum
to have fully proclaimed
the
gospel
-
of Christ
thus
now
being ambitious
to preach the gospel
not
where
had been named
Christ
so that
not
upon
anotherâs
foundation
I might build
Rather
as
it has been written
They will see
to whom
not
it was proclaimed
concerning
Him
and
those that
not
have heard
will understand
Therefore
also
I have been hindered
-
many [times]
-
to come
to
you
Now
however
no longer
a place
having
in
the
regions
these
a great desire
now
having had
-
to come
to
you
for
many
years
whenever
-
I may go
to
-
Spain
I hope
for
going through
to see
you
and
by
you
to be equipped
there
if
of you
first
in
part
I should be filled
Now
however
I am going
to
Jerusalem
ministering
to the
saints
Were pleased
for
Macedonia
and
Achaia
a contribution
certain
to make
for
the
poor
among the
saints
-
in
Jerusalem
They were pleased
for
and
debtors
they are
of them
If
for
the things
spiritual
of them
have shared in
the
Gentiles
they ought
also
in
the
material things
to minister
to them
This
therefore
having finished
and
having sealed
to them
the
fruit
this
I will set off
through
you
into
Spain
I know
now
that
coming
to
you
in
[the] fullness
of the blessing
of Christ
I will come
I exhort
now
you
brothers
by
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
by
the
love
of the
Spirit
to strive together with
me
in
the
prayers
for
me
to
-
God
so that
I may be delivered
from
those
refusing to be persuaded
in
-
Judea
and
the
service
of me
which [is]
in
Jerusalem
acceptable
to the
saints
may be
so that
in
joy
having come
to
you
by [the]
will
of God
I may be refreshed with
you
-
And
the God
-
of peace
[be] with
all
of you
Amen
I commend
now

Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
Father
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus

I thank
the
God
always
concerning
you
for
the
grace
-
of God
-
having been given
you
in
Christ
Jesus
that
in
everything
you have been enriched
in
Him
in
all
speech
and
all
knowledge
as
the
testimony
about
Christ
was confirmed
in
you
so as for
you
not
to be lacking
in
not one
gift
eagerly awaiting
the
revelation
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
who
also
will sustain
you
to [the]
end
blameless
in
the
day
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
Faithful [is]
-
God
by
whom
you were called
into
fellowship
with the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us
I exhort
now
you
brothers
by
the
name
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
that
the
same thing
you speak
all
and
not
there be
among
you
divisions
you may be
however
having been knit together
in
the
same
mind
and
in
the
same
judgment
It was shown
for
to me
concerning
you
brothers
of me
by
those
of Chloe
that
quarrels
among
you
there are
I mean
now
this
that
each
of you
says
I
indeed
am
of Paul
I
and
of Apollos
I
and
of Cephas
I
and
of Christ
Has been divided
-
Christ
Not
Paul
was crucified
for
you
Or
into
the
name
of Paul
were you baptized
I thank
that
no one
of you
I baptized
if
not
Crispus
and
Gaius
so that
not
anyone
should say
that
into
-
my
name
you were baptized
I baptized
now
also
the
of Stephanas
household
as to the rest
not
I know
whether
any
other
I baptized
Not
for
sent
me
Christ
to baptize
but
to preach the gospel
not
in
wisdom
of discourse
that
not
be emptied of power
the
cross
of the
Christ
The
message
for
-
of the
cross
to those
indeed
perishing
foolishness
is
those
however
being saved
to us
power
of God
it is
It has been written
for
I will destroy
the
wisdom
of the
wise
and
the
intelligence
of the
intelligent
I will frustrate
Where [is the]
wise
Where [the]
scribe
Where [the]
debater
the
age
of this
Not
has made foolish
-
God
the
wisdom
of the
world
Since
for
in
the
wisdom
-
of God
not
knew
the
world
through
the
wisdom
-
God
was pleased
-
God
through
the
foolishness
of the
proclamation
to save
those
believing
Seeing that
both
Jews
signs
ask for
and
Greeks
wisdom
seek
we
however
preach
Christ
having been crucified
to [the] Jewish
indeed
a stumbling block
to Gentiles
now
foolishness
to them
however
the
called
Jews
both
and
Greeks
Christ
of God
[the] power
and
of God
[the] wisdom
For
the
foolishness
-
of God
wiser
-
than men
is
and
the
weakness
-
of God
stronger
-
than men
Consider
for
the
calling
of you
brothers
that
not
many
wise
according to
flesh [were]
not
many
powerful
not
many
of noble birth
But
the
foolish things
of the
world
has chosen
-
God
that
He might shame
the
wise
and
the
weak things
of the
world
chose
-
God
that
He might shame
the
strong
and
the
low-born
of the
world
and
the things
being despised
chose
-
God
the things
not
being
that
the things
being
He might annul
so that
not
might boast
all
flesh
before
-
God
Out of
Him
however
you
are
in
Christ
Jesus
who
has been made
wisdom
unto us
from
God
righteousness
and
also
sanctification
and
redemption
in order that
as
it has been written
The [one]
boasting
in [the]
Lord
let him boast
And I
having come
to
you
brothers
came
not
according to
excellency
of speech
or
wisdom
proclaiming
to you
the
testimony
-
of God
Nothing
for
I decided
anything
to know
among
you
if
not
Jesus
Christ
and
Him
having been crucified
And I
in
weakness
and
in
fear
and
in
trembling
much
was
with
you
And
the
message
of me
and
the
preaching
of me
[were] not
in
persuasive
of wisdom
words
but
in
demonstration
of [the] Spirit
and
of power
so that
the
faith
of you
not
might be
in
wisdom
of men
but
in
power
of God
Wisdom
however
we speak
among
the
mature
wisdom
however
not
the
age
of this
nor
of the
rulers
the
age
of this
who
are coming to naught
But
we speak
of God
wisdom
in
a mystery
-
having been hidden
which
foreordained
-
God
before
the
ages
for
glory
of us
which
none
of the
rulers
the
age
of this
has understood
if
for
they had understood [it]
not
-
the
Lord
-
of glory
they would have crucified
but
as
it has been written
What
eye
not
has seen
and
ear
not
has heard
and
into
heart
of man
not
has entered
what
has prepared
-
God
for those
loving
Him
To us
for
has revealed [it]
-
God
through
the
Spirit
The
for
Spirit
all things
searches
even
the
depths
-
of God
Who
for
knows
among men
the things
of the
man
if
not
the
spirit
of the
man
that [is]
within
him
So
also
the things
-
of God
no one
knows
if
not
the
Spirit
-
of God
We
now
not
the
spirit
of the
world
have received
but
the
Spirit
who [is]
from
-
God
that
we may know
the things
by
-
God
having been granted
to us
which
also
we speak
not
in
taught
of human
wisdom
words
but
in [those]
taught
of [the] Spirit
by spiritual [means]
spiritual things
communicating
[The] natural
however
man
not
accepts
the things
of the
Spirit
-
of God
foolishness
for
to him
they are
and
not
he is able
to understand [them]
because
spiritually
they are discerned
He who [is]
however
spiritual
judges
-
all things
he himself
however
by
no one
is judged
Who
for
has known
[the] mind
of [the] Lord
Who
will instruct
Him
We
however
[the] mind
of Christ
have
And I
brothers
not
was able
to speak
to you
as
to spiritual
but
as
to fleshly
as
to infants
in
Christ
Milk
you
I gave to drink
not
solid food
not yet
for
were you able
In fact
not
still
now
are you able
still
for
fleshly
you are
Where
for
[are] among
you
jealousy
and
strife
not
fleshly
are you
and
according to
man
are walking
When
for
might say
one
I
indeed
am
of Paul
another
however
I
of Apollos
not
fleshly
are you
Who
then
is
Apollos
Who
now
is
Paul
Servants
through
whom
you believed
also
to each
as
the
Lord
has given
I
planted
Apollos
watered
but
-
God
kept [it] growing
So
neither
the [one]
planting
is
anything
nor
the [one]
watering
but [only]
the [One]
giving growth
God
The [one]
planting
now
and
the [one]
watering
one
are
each
now
the
own
reward
will receive
according to
the
own
labor
Of God
for
we are
fellow workers
Godâs
field
Godâs
building
you are
According to
the
grace
-
of God
-
having been given
to me
as
a wise
master builder
[the] foundation
I have laid
another
however
is building upon [it]
Each one
however
let take heed
how
he builds upon [it]
Foundation
for
another
no one
is able
to lay
besides
the [one]
being already laid
which
is
Jesus
Christ
If
now
anyone
builds
upon
the
foundation
gold
silver
stones
precious
wood
hay
straw
of each
the
work
manifest
will become
the
for
day
will disclose [it]
because
in
fire
it is revealed
and
of each
the
work
what sort
it is
the
fire
itself
will prove
If
of anyone
the
work
will remain
which
he built up
a reward
he will receive
If
of anyone
the
work
will be burned up
he will suffer loss
he himself
however
will be saved
so
however
as
through
fire
Not
know you
that
temple
of God
you yourselves are
and
the
Spirit
-
of God
in
you
dwells
If
anyone
the
temple
-
of God
destroys
will destroy
him
-
God
-
for
the temple
-
of God
holy
is
which
are
you
No one
himself
let deceive
if
anyone
thinks [himself]
wise
to be
among
you
in
the
age
this
foolish
let him become
so that
he may become
wise
The
for
wisdom
of the
world
this
foolishness
with
-
God
is
It has been written
for
[He is] the [One]
catching
the
wise
in
the
craftiness
of them
And
again
[The] Lord
knows
the
thoughts
of the
wise
that
they are
futile
Therefore
no one
let boast
in
men
All things
for
of you
are
whether
Paul
or
Apollos
or
Cephas
or [the]
world
or
life
or
death
or
things present
or
things to come
all
yours
you
now
of Christ
Christ
now
of God
So
us
let regard
a man
as
servants
of Christ
and
stewards
of the mysteries
of God
In this case
moreover
it is required
in
the
stewards
that
faithful
one
shall be found
Me
however
to
the smallest matter
it is
that
by
you
I be examined
or
by
a human
court
In fact
neither
myself
do I examine
Nothing
for
against myself
I am conscious of
yet
not
by
this
have I been justified
the [One]
however
judging
me
[the] Lord
is
So then
not
before [the]
time
anything
judge
until
-
shall have come
the
Lord
who
both
will bring to light
the
hidden things
-
of darkness
and
will make manifest
the
motives
of the
hearts
and
then
the
praise
will come
to each
from
-
God
These things
now
brothers
I have applied
to
myself
and
Apollos
on account of
you
so that
in
us
you may learn
-
not
beyond
what
has been written
that
not
one
for
-
one
you be puffed up
over
the
other
Who
for
you
makes different
What
now
have you
which
not
you did receive
If
now
also
you did receive [it]
why
boast you
as
not
having received [it]
Already
satiated
you are
already
you have been enriched
apart from
us
you reigned
and
I wish that
really
you did reign
so that
also
we
you
might reign with
I think
for
-
God
us
-
apostles
last
has exhibited
as
appointed to death
because
a spectacle
we have become
to the
world
both
to angels
and
to men
We
[are] fools
on account of
Christ
you
however
wise
in
Christ
we
weak
you
however
strong
You
honored
we
however
without honor
As far as
the
present
hour
both
we hunger
and
thirst
and
are poorly clad
and
are buffeted
and
wander homeless
and
we toil
working
with [our]
own
hands
Being reviled
we bless
being persecuted
we endure
being slandered
we entreat
As
[the] scum
of the
earth
we have become
of all [the]
refuse
until
now
Not
shaming
you
do I write
these things
but
as
children
my
beloved
admonishing [you]
If
for
ten thousand
guardians
you should have
in
Christ
yet
not
many
fathers
in
for
Christ
Jesus
through
the
gospel
I
you
have begotten
I exhort
therefore
you
imitators
of me
become
On account of
this
it [is]
I sent
to you
Timothy
who
is
my
child
beloved
and
faithful
in [the]
Lord
who
you
will remind of
the
ways
of me
that [are]
in
Christ
Jesus
as
everywhere
in
every
church
I teach
As to
not
coming
now
of me
to
you
have become puffed up
some
I will come
however
shortly
to
you
if
the
Lord
wills
and
I will find out
not
the
talk
of those
being puffed up
but
the
power
Not
for
in
word
the
kingdom
-
of God [is]
but
in
power
What
desire you
With
a rod
I should come
to
you
or
in
love
a spirit
then
of gentleness
Actually
is reported
among
you
sexual immorality
and
such
sexual immorality
as
not even
among
the
pagans
so as for
[the] wife
one
of the
father
to have
And
you
puffed up
are
and
not
rather
have mourned
so that
might be taken
out of
midst
of you
the [one]
the
deed
this
having done
I
indeed
though
being absent
-
in body
being present
now
-
in spirit
already
have judged
as
being present
the [one]
so
this
having produced
in
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
having been gathered together
you
and
-
of me
in spirit
with
the
power
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
to deliver
-
such a one
-
to Satan
for
destruction
of the
flesh
so that
the
spirit
may be saved
in
the
day
of the
Lord
Not
good [is]
the
boasting
of you
Not
know you
that
a little
leaven
all
the
lump
leavens
Cleanse out
the
old
leaven
that
you may be
a new
lump
as
you are
unleavened
Also
for
the
Passover lamb
of us
has been sacrificed
Christ
so that
we might celebrate the feast
not
with
leaven
old
not
with
leaven
of malice
and
wickedness
but
with
unleavened [bread]
of sincerity
and
of truth
I wrote
to you
in
the
letter
not
to associate with
the sexually immoral
not
altogether
with the
sexually immoral
the
world
of this
or
with the
covetous
and
swindlers
or
idolaters
since
you would need
then
from
the
world
to depart
Now
however
I wrote
to you
not
to associate with [him]
if
anyone
a brother
being designated
he is
sexually immoral
or
a coveter
or
an idolater
or
verbal abuser
or
a drunkard
or
swindler
with
such a one
not even
to eat
What
for
[is it] to me
those
outside
to judge
Not
those
within
you
do judge
Those
however
outside
-
God
will judge
Expel
the
evil
out from
yourselves
that
Dare
anyone
of you
a matter
having
against
the
other
go to law
before
the
unrighteous
and
not
before
the
saints
Or
not
know you
that
the
saints
the
world
will judge
And
if
by
you
is to be judged
the
world
unworthy
are you
of cases
of the smallest
Not
know you
that
angels
we will judge
How much more
the things of this life
The things of this life
indeed
so
judgment [as to]
if
you have
the [ones]
being despised
in
the
church
those
set you up
For
shame
to you
I say this
Thus
not
is there
among
you
no one
a wise [man]
who
will be able
to decide
in
between
the
brother
of him
Instead
brother
against
brother
goes to law
and
this
before
unbelievers
Already
indeed
therefore
altogether
a defeat
for you
it is
that
lawsuits
you have
among
one another
Because of
why
not
rather
suffer wrong
Because of
why
not
rather
be defrauded
But
you
do wrong
and
defraud
and
these things
to brothers
Or
not
know you
that
[the] unrighteous ones
of God
[the] kingdom
not
will inherit
Not
be deceived
neither
the sexually immoral
nor
idolaters
nor
adulterers
nor
effeminate
nor
homosexuals
nor
thieves
nor
coveters
not
drunkards
nor
verbal abusers
nor
swindlers
[the] kingdom
of God
will inherit
And
such
some [of]
you were
but
you were washed
but
you were sanctified
but
you were justified
in
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
by
the
Spirit
of the
God
of us
All things
to me
are lawful
but
not
all things
do profit
All things
to me
are lawful
but
not
I
will be mastered
by
anything
The
foods
for the
belly
and
the
belly
the
for foods
-
but
God
both
this
and
these
will destroy
-
and
the body [is]
not
-
for sexual immorality
but
for the
Lord
and
the
Lord
for the
body
-
And
God
both
the
Lord
has raised up
and
us
will raise out
by
the
power
of Him
Not
know you
that
the
bodies
of you
members
of Christ
are
Having taken
then
the
members
of the
Christ
shall I make
[them] of a prostitute
members
Never
may it be
Or
not
know you
that
the [one]
being joined
to the
prostitute
one
body
is
Will become
for
it says
the
two
into
flesh
one
The [one]
however
being joined
to the
Lord
one
spirit
is
Flee
-
sexual immorality
Every
sin
whatever
if
might do
a man
outside
the
body
is
the [one]
however
sinning sexually
against
the
own
body
sins
Or
not
know you
that
the
body
of you
a temple
of the
in
you
Holy
Spirit
is
whom
you have
from
God
And
not
you are
your own
you were bought
for
with a price
glorify
therefore
-
God
in
the
body
of you
Concerning
now
the things about which
you wrote
[It is] good
for a man
a woman
not
to touch
Because of
however
-
sexual immorality
each man
the [own]
of him
wife
let have
and
each [woman]
the
own
husband
let have
To the
wife
the
husband
the
duty
let fulfill
likewise
now
also
the
wife
to the
husband
The
wife
the
own
body
not
has authority over
but
the
husband
likewise
now
also
the
husband
of the
own
body
not
has authority over
but
the
wife
Not
deprive
one another
if
not
-
by
mutual agreement
for
a time
that
you might be at leisure
-
for prayer
and
again
together
the
same
be
so that
not
may tempt
you
-
Satan
through
the
lack of self-control
of you
This
now
I say
by way of
concession
not
by way of
command
I wish
now
all
men
to be
like
even
myself
But
each
his own
has
gift
from
God
one [has]
indeed
this
one
however
that
I say
now
to the
unmarried
and
to the
widows
[it is] good
for them
if
they should remain
as
even I
If
however
not
they have self-control
let them marry
better
for
it is
to marry
than
to burn with passion
To those
now
having married
I give this charge
not
I
but
the
Lord
A wife
from
a husband
not
is to be separated
if
however
indeed
she is separated
let her remain
unmarried
or
to the
husband
be reconciled
and
a husband
a wife
not
is to send away
To the
now
rest
I say
I
not
the
Lord
If
any
brother
a wife
has
unbelieving
and
she
consents
to dwell
with
him
not
let him divorce
her
And
a woman
any
has
a husband
unbelieving
and
he
consents
to dwell
with
her
not
let her divorce
the
husband
Is sanctified
for
the
husband
-
unbelieving
in
the
wife
and
is sanctified
the
wife
-
unbelieving
in
the
husband
else
then
the
children
of you
unclean
are
now
however
holy
they are
If
however
the
unbeliever
separates himself
let him separate himself
not
is under bondage
the
brother
or
the
sister
in
-
such [cases]
Into
however
peace
has called
you
-
God
How
for
know you
wife
if
the
husband
you will save
Or
how
know you
husband
if
the
wife
you will save
If
not
to each
as
has assigned
the
Lord
to each
as
has called
-
God
so
let him walk
And
thus
in
the
churches
all
I prescribe
Having been circumcised
anyone
was called
Not
let him be uncircumcised
In
uncircumcision
was called
anyone
Not
let Him be circumcised
-
Circumcision
nothing
is
and
-
uncircumcision
nothing
is
but
keeping
[the] commandments
of God
Each
in
the
calling
in which
he has been called
in
this
let him abide
Slave [being]
were you called
not
to you
let it be a care
but
if
also
you are able
free
to become
rather
take advantage
The [one]
for
in
[the] Lord
having been called
[being] a slave
a freedman
of [the] Lord
is
likewise
the [one]
free
having been called
a slave
is
of Christ
With a price
you were bought
not
become
slaves
of men
Each
wherein
that
he was called
brothers
in
that
let him abide
with
God
Concerning
now
the
virgins
a commandment
of [the] Lord
not
I have
judgment
however
I give
as
having received mercy
from
[the] Lord
trustworthy
to be
I think
therefore
this
good
is
because of
the
present
necessity
that
[it is] good
for a man
-
in the same manner
to remain
Have you been bound
to a wife
Not
seek
to be loosed
Have you been loosed
from
a wife
Not
seek
a wife
If
however
also
you shall have married
not
you did sin
and
if
shall have married
the
virgin
not
she did sin
tribulation
however
in the
flesh
will have
-
such
I
now
you
am sparing
This
now
I say
brothers
The
season
shortened
is
-
From now on
that
both
those
having
wives
as
none
having
should be
and
those
weeping
as
not
weeping
and
those
rejoicing
as
not
rejoicing
and
those
buying
as
not
possessing
and
those
using
the
world
as
not
using [it] as their own
Is passing away
for
the
present form
of the
world
this
I desire
now
you
without concern
to be
The
unmarried man
cares for
the things
of the
Lord
how
he should please
the
Lord
the [one]
however
having been married
cares for
the things
of the
world
how
he should please
the
wife
and
is divided
And
the
woman
-
unmarried
and
-
virgin
cares for
the things
of the
Lord
that
she should be
holy
both
in
body
and
in
spirit
the [one]
however
having been married
cares for
the things
of the
world
how
she should please
the
husband
This
now
for
the
of you
yourselves
benefit
I say
not
that
a restraint
you
I might place upon
but
for
what
[is] seemly
and
devoted
to the
Lord
without distraction
If
however
anyone
to be behaving improperly
to
the
virgin
of him
supposes
if
she is
beyond youth
and
so
it ought
to be
what
he wills
let him do
not
he does sin
let them marry
He who
however
stands
in
the
heart
of him
firm
not
having
necessity
authority
however
having
over
the
own
will
and
this
has judged
in
the
own
heart
to keep
-
the
virgin
well
he will do
So then
also
the [one]
marrying
the
own
virgin
well
does
and
the [one]
not
marrying
better
will do
A wife
is bound
for
as long as
time
may live
the
husband
of her
if
however
shall have died
the
husband
free
she is
to whom
she wills
to be married
only
in
[the] Lord
More blessed
however
she is
if
in the same manner
she should remain
according to
-
my
judgment
I think
now
myself also
[the] Spirit
of God
to have
Concerning
now
the things
sacrificed to idols
we know
indeed
all
knowledge
we have
-
Knowledge
puffs up
-
but
love
builds up
If
anyone
thinks
to have known
anything
not yet
does he know
as
it is necessary
to know
If
however
anyone
loves
-
God
he
is known
by
Him
Concerning
the
eating
therefore
of the
things sacrificed to idols
we know
that
nothing
an idol
[is] in
[the] world
and
that [there is]
no
God
if
not
one
Even
truly
if indeed
there are
[those] called
gods
whether
in
heaven
or
on
earth
as
there are
gods
many
and
lords
many
yet
to us
[there is] one
God
the
Father
of
whom [are]
the things
all
and
we
for
Him
and
one
Lord
Jesus
Christ
by
whom [are]
the things
all
and
we
through
Him
But
not
in
all [is]
this
knowledge
Some
now
-
by habit
until
now
of the
idol
as of
a thing sacrificed to an idol
eat
and
the
conscience
of them
weak
being
it is defiled
Food
however
us
not
will commend
to
God
neither
if
not
we should eat
do we come short
nor
if
we should eat
have we an advantage
Be careful
however
lest
somehow
the
right
of you
this
an occasion of stumbling
becomes
to those
being weak
If
for
anyone
sees
you
-
having
knowledge
in
an idolâs temple
eating
not
the
conscience
of him
weak
being
will be built up
so as
the
things
sacrificed to idols
to eat
Is destroyed
for
the [one]
being weak
through
-
your
knowledge
the
brother
for
whom
Christ
died
Thus
then
sinning
against
the
brothers
and
wounding
their
-
conscience
being weak
against
Christ
you sin
Therefore
if
food
snares
the
brother
of me
never
not
shall I eat
meat
to
the
age
so that
not
the
brother
of me
I might snare
Not
am I
free
Not
am I
an apostle
Not
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
have I seen
Not
the
work
of me
you
are
in
[the] Lord
If
to others
not
I am
an apostle
yet
at least
to you
I am
the
for
seal
of my
the
apostleship
you
are
in
[the] Lord
-
My
defense
to those
me
examining
is
this
No
not
have we
[the] right
to eat
and
to drink
No
not
have we
authority
a sister
a wife
to take about
as
also
the
other
apostles
and
the
brothers
of the
Lord
and
Cephas
Or
only
I
and
Barnabas
not
have we
authority
not
to work
Who
serves as a soldier
at his own
expense
at any time
Who
plants
a vineyard
and
the
fruit
of it
not
does eat
Or
who
shepherds
a flock
and
from
the
milk
of the
flock
not
does drink
Not
according to
man
these things
do I speak
Or
also
the
law
these things
not
says
In
for
the
of Moses
law
it has been written
Not
you shall muzzle
an ox
treading out grain
Not
for the
oxen
is there care
-
with God
Or
because of
us
entirely
is He speaking
For sake of
us
for
it was written
because
ought
in
hope
the [one]
plowing
to plow
and
the [one]
threshing
in
hope
-
to partake
If
we
among you
-
spiritual things
have sown
[is it] a great thing
if
we
from you
-
material things
will reap
If
others
of the
over you
authority
partake
[should] not
more
we
But
not
we did use
the
right
this
Instead
all things
we bear
so that
not
any
hindrance
we should place
to the
gospel
of
Christ
Not
know you
that
those
in the
temple
working
the things
of
the
temple
eat
those
at the
altar
attending
in the
altar
partake
So
also
the
Lord
has prescribed
to those
the
gospel
proclaiming
from
the
gospel
to live
I
however
not
have used
none
of these
Neither
have I written
now
these things
that
thus
it should be
with
me
[it were] good
for
me
rather
to die
than
the
boasting
of me
anyone
will make void
If
for
I preach the gospel
nothing
there is
to me
boasting
necessity
for
me
is laid upon
Woe
however
to me
be
if
not
I should preach the gospel
If
for
willingly
this
I do
a reward
I have
if
however
unwillingly
a stewardship
I am entrusted with
What
then
of me
is
the
reward
That
in preaching the gospel
free of charge
I should offer
the
gospel
so as
-
not
to use up
the
right
of me
in
the
gospel
Free
for
being
from
all
to all
myself
I became servant
so that
the
more
I might gain
And
I became
to the
Jews
like
a Jew
so that
Jews
I might win
To those
under
[the] Law
as
under
[the] law
not
being
myself
under
[the] law
so that
those
under
[the] law
I might win
To those
outside [the] Law
like
outside [the] Law
not
being
outside [the] law
of God
but
under [the] law
to Christ
so that
I might win
those
outside [the] Law
I became
to the
weak
weak
that
the
weak
I might win
These things
to all
I have become
all
so that
by all means
some
I might save
All [things]
now
I do
on account of
the
gospel
that
a fellow partaker
with it
I might become
Not
know you
that
those
in
a race course
running
all
indeed
run
one
however
receives
the
prize
Thus
run
that
you might obtain [it]
Everyone
now
-
striving
in all things
controls himself
they
indeed
then
that
a perishable
crown
they might receive
we
however
an imperishable
I
therefore
thus
run
as
not
uncertainly
so
I fight
as
not
[the] air
beating
But
I batter
of me
the
body
and
bring [it] into servitude
not
hardly
to others
having preached
myself
disqualified
I might be
Not
I want
for
you
to be ignorant
brothers
that
the
fathers
of us
all
under
the
cloud
were
and
all
through
the
sea
passed
and
all
into
-
Moses
were baptized
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
sea
and
all
the
same
spiritual
food
ate
and
all
the
same
spiritual
drank
drink
they were drinking
for
from
[the] spiritual
accompanying [them]
rock
the
rock
then
was
-
Christ
Nevertheless
not
with
-
most
of them
was well pleased
-
God
they were strewn
for
in
the
wilderness
These things
now
types
to us
have become
for
-
not
to be
us
desirers
of evil things
as
they also
desired
Neither
idolaters
are you to be
as
some
of them
as
it has been written
Sat down
the
people
to eat
and
to drink
and
rose up
to play
Neither
should we commit sexual immorality
as
some
of them
committed sexual immorality
and
fell
in one
day
twenty
thousand
Neither
should we test
the
Christ
as
some
of them
tested
and
by
-
serpents
were destroyed
Neither
are you to grumble
as
some
of them
grumbled
and
perished
by
the
Destroyer
These things
now
[as] types
happened
to them
were written
then
for
admonition
of us
to
whom
the
ends
of the
ages
are arrived
Therefore
the [one]
thinking
to stand
let him take heed
lest
he fall
Temptation
you
not
has seized
if
not
what is common to man
faithful
now
-
[is] God
who
not
will allow
you
to be tempted
beyond
what
you are able
but
will provide
with
the
temptation
also
the
escape
-
to be able
to endure [it]
Therefore
beloved
of me
flee
from
-
idolatry
As
to sensible [ones]
I speak
judge
for yourselves
what
I say
The
cup
-
of blessing
that
we bless
not
a participation
is it
in the
blood
-
of Christ
The
bread
that
we break
not
a participation
in the
body
-
of Christ
is it
Because [there is]
one
loaf
one
body
the
many
we are
-
for
all
of
the
one
loaf
we partake
Consider
-
Israel
according to
flesh
Not
those
eating
the
sacrifices
fellow partakers
in the
altar
are
What
then
do I mean
That
what is sacrificed to an idol
anything
is
or
that
an idol
anything
is
Rather
that
what
sacrifice
to demons
and
not
to God
they sacrifice
Not
I do wish
now
you
fellow partakers
-
with demons
to be
Not
you are able
[the] cup
of [the] Lord
to drink
and
[the] cup
of demons
Not
you are able
of [the] table
of [the] Lord
to partake
and
of [the] table
of demons
Or
do we provoke to jealousy
the
Lord
Not
stronger
than He
are we
All things
are lawful
but
not
all things
are profitable
All things
are lawful
but
not
all
edify
No one
the [good]
of himself
let seek
but
that
of the
other
Everything
-
in
the meat market
being sold
eat
nothing
inquiring
on account of
-
conscience
The
Lordâs
for
[is] the
earth
and
the
fullness
of it
If
anyone
invites
you
of the
unbelieving
and
you wish
to go
everything
-
being set before
you
eat
nothing
inquiring
on account of
-
conscience
If
however
anyone
to you
should say
This
offered to an idol
is
not
do eat
on account of
him
-
having shown [it]
and
-
conscience
[the] conscience
now
I am saying
not
-
your own
but
that
of the
other
that
what
for
the
freedom
of me
is judged
by
anotherâs
conscience
If
I
with thankfulness
partake
why
am I denounced
for
that which
I
give thanks
Whether
therefore
you eat
or
drink
or
whatever
you do
all things
to the
glory
of God
do
Without offense
both
to Jews
be you
and
Greeks
and
to the
church
-
of God
as
I also
all
in all things
please
not
seeking
the
of myself
profit
but
that
of the
many
that
they may be saved
Imitators
of me
be
as
I also [am]
of Christ
I commend
now
you
that
in all things
me
you have remembered
and
as
I delivered
to you
the
teachings
you are keeping
I want
however
you
to know
that
of every
man
the
head
-
Christ
is
[the] head
now
of [the] woman [is]
the
man
[the] head
now
-
of Christ
-
God
Every
man
praying
or
prophesying
[anything] on
[his] head
having
dishonors
the
head
of him
Every
now
woman
praying
or
prophesying
uncovered
with the
head
dishonors
the
head
of her
one
for
it is
and
the
same
-
with having been shaven
If
for
not
covers her head
a woman
also
let her be shorn
If [it is]
now
disgraceful
to a woman
-
to be shorn
or
to be shaven
let her cover her head
A man
truly
for
not
ought
to cover
the
head
image
and
glory
of God
being
the
woman
however
[the] glory
of man
is
Not
for
is
man
of
woman
but
woman
of
man
Truly
for
not
was created
man
on account of
the
woman
but
woman
on account of
the
man
Because of
this
ought
the
woman
authority
to have
on
the
head
on account of
the
angels
However
neither [is]
woman
separate from
man
nor
man
separate from
woman
in
[the] Lord
Just as
for
the
woman
of
the
man [is]
so
also
the
man
by
the
woman [is]
the
however
all things
of
-
God
In
you
yourselves
judge
Becoming
is it
for a woman
revealed
-
to God
to pray
Not even
-
nature
itself
does teach
you
that
a man
indeed
if
he has long hair
a dishonor
to him
it is
a woman
however
if
she has long hair
glory
to her
it is
For
the
long hair
instead
of a covering
is given
to her
If
now
anyone
is inclined
contentious
to be
we
such
custom
no [other]
have
nor
the
churches
-
of God
In this
now
instructing
not
I do praise
because
not
for
the
better
but
for
the
worse
you come together
First
indeed
for
coming together
you
in
an assembly
I hear
divisions
among
you
there to be
and
in part
it
I believe
It behooves
for
also
factions
among
you
there to be
so that
also
the
approved
evident
should become
among
you
Coming
therefore
of you
together
in one
place
not
it is
[the] Lordâs
supper
to eat
One
for
the
own
supper
takes first
in
-
eating
and
this [one]
indeed
is hungry
that [one]
however
is drunken
No
indeed
houses
not
have you
in
which
to eat
and
to drink
Or
the
church
-
of God
do you despise
and
put to shame
those
nothing
having
What
shall I say
to you
Shall I praise
you
in
this
Not
I praise [you]
I
for
received
from
the
Lord
that which
also
I delivered
to you
that
the
Lord
Jesus
in
the
night
in which
He was betrayed
took
bread
and
having given thanks
He broke [it]
and
said
This
of Me
is
the
body
which [is]
for
you
this
do
in
-
of Me
remembrance
Likewise
also
the
cup
after
-
having supped
saying
This
-
cup
the
new
covenant
is
in
-
My
blood
this
do
as often as
if
you might drink [it]
in
-
of Me
remembrance
As often as
for
if
you may eat
the
bread
this
and
the
cup
may drink
the
death
of the
Lord
you proclaim
until
that
He should come
Therefore
whoever
-
should eat
the
bread
or
should drink
the
cup
of the
Lord
unworthily
guilty
will be
of the
body
and
of the
blood
of the
Lord
Let examine
however
a man
himself
and
in this manner
of
the
bread
let him eat
and
of
the
cup
let him drink
The [one]
for
eating
and
drinking
judgment
on himself
eats
and
drinks
not
discerning
the
body
Because of
this
among
you
many
[are] weak
and
sick
and
are fallen asleep
many
If
for
ourselves
we were judging
not
-
we would come under judgment
Being judged
however
by
the
Lord
we are disciplined
so that
not
with
the
world
we should be condemned
So then
brothers
of me
coming together
in order
-
to eat
one another
wait for
If
anyone
is hungry
at
home
let him eat
so that
not
for
judgment
you might come together
-
And
the other things
as soon as
-
I might come
I will set in order
Concerning
now
-
spiritual [gifts]
brothers
not
I do want
you
to be ignorant
You know
that
when
pagans
you were
to
-
idols
-
mute
even as
-
you were led
being carried away
Therefore
I make known
to you
that
no one
in
[the] Spirit
of God
speaking
says
Accursed [is]
Jesus
and
no one
is able
to say
Lord [is]
Jesus
if
not
in
[the] Spirit
Holy
Varieties
now
of gifts
there are
-
but
the same
Spirit
and
varieties
of services
there are
but
the
same
Lord
and
varieties
of workings
there are
the
but
same
God
-
is working
the
all things
in
everyone
To each
now
is given
the
manifestation
of the
Spirit
for
the
common profiting
To one
truly
for
through
the
Spirit
is given
a word
of wisdom
to another
now
a word
of knowledge
according to
the
same
Spirit
and to a different one
faith
by
the
same
Spirit
to another
now
gifts
of healing
in
that
one
Spirit
to another
now
working
of miracles
to another
now
prophecy
to another
now
distinguishing
of spirits
and to a different one
various kinds
of tongues
to another
now
interpretation
of tongues
All
now
these things
works
the
one
and
the
same
Spirit
apportioning
individually
to each
as
He wills
Just as
for
the
body
one
is
and
members
many
has
all
now
the
members
of the
body
many
being
one
are
body
so
also [is]
-
Christ
Also
for
in
one
Spirit
we
all
into
one
body
were baptized
whether
Jews
or
Greeks
whether
slaves
or
free
and
all
one
Spirit
we were made to drink
Also
for
the
body
not
is
one
member
but
many
If
should say
the
foot
Because
not
I am
a hand
not
I am
of
the
body
not
on account of
this
not
is it
of
the
body
And
if
should say
the
ear
Because
not
I am
an eye
not
I am
of
the
body
not
on account of
this
not
is it
of
the
body
If
all
the
body [were]
an eye
where
[would be] the
hearing
If
all
[were] hearing
where
[would be] the
sense of smell
Now
however
-
God
has arranged
the
members
one
each
of them
in
the
body
as
He desired
If
now
were
-
all
one
member
where
[would be] the
body
Now
however
many
even
[are the] members
one
however
body
Not
is able
now
the
eye
to say
to the
hand
Need
of you
not
I have
Or
again
the
head
to the
feet
Need
of you
not
I have
But
much
rather
those
seeming
members
of the
body
weaker
to be
indispensable
are
and
those which
we think
less honorable
to be
of the
body
these
honor
more abundant
we bestow
and
the
unpresentable [parts]
of us
decorum
more abundant
have
-
and
the presentable [parts]
of us
no
need
have
But
-
God
has composed
the
body
to the [parts]
being deficient
more abundant
having given
honor
that
not
there should be
division
in
the
body
but
the
same
for
one another
should have concern
the
members
And
if
suffers
one
member
suffer with [it]
all
the
members
if
is honored
member
rejoice with [it]
all
the
members
You
now
are
[the] body
of Christ
and
members
in
particular
And
some
indeed
has appointed
-
God
in
the
church
first
apostles
secondly
prophets
third
teachers
then
miracles
then
gifts
of healing
helping
administrating
various kinds
of tongues
Not [are]
all
apostles
Not
all
prophets
Not
all
teachers
Not [have]
all
miracles
Not
all
gifts
have
of healings
Not
all
in tongues
do speak
Not
all
do interpret
Be desirous of
however
the
gifts
-
greater
And
now
according to
a more surpassing
way
to you
I show
If
in the
tongues
-
of men
I speak
and
-
of angels
love
however
not
have
I have become
a brass
sounding
or
a cymbal
clanging
And
if
I should have
prophecy
and
understand
the
mysteries
all
and
all
the
knowledge
and
if
I should have
all
the
faith
so as
mountains
to remove
love
however
not
have
nothing
I am
And
if
I may give away
all
the
possessions
of me
and
if
I may deliver up
the
body
of me
that
I may boast
love
however
not
have
nothing
I am profited
-
Love
is patient
is kind
-
love
not
is envious
-
love
not
is boastful
not
is puffed up
not
acts unbecomingly
not
seeks
the things
of its own
not
is easily provoked
not
it keeps account
-
of wrongs
not
delights
at
-
unrighteousness
rejoices
however
in the
truth
All things
it bears
all things
believes
all things
hopes
all things
endures
-
Love
never
fails
if
however
[there are] prophesies
they will be done away
if
tongues
they will be ceased
if
knowledge
it will pass away
In
part
for
we know
and
in
part
we prophesy
when
however
should come
the
perfect
the
in
part
will be done away
When
I was
a child
I was speaking
like
a child
I was thinking
like
a child
I was reasoning
like
a child
when
I became
a man
I did away with
the things
of the
child
We see
for
presently
through
a glass
in
obscurity
then
however
face
to
face
presently
I know
in
part
then
however
I will know fully
as
also
I have been fully known
Now
however
abide
faith
hope
love
the things
three
these
[the] greatest
however
of these [is]
-
love
Earnestly pursue
-
love
earnestly desire
now
-
spiritual gifts
especially
now
that
you might prophesy
The [one]
for
speaking
in a tongue
not
to men
speaks
but
to God
no one
for
hears
in the Spirit
however
he utters
mysteries
The [one]
however
prophesying
to men
speaks [for]
edification
and
encouragement
and
consolation
The [one]
speaking
in a tongue
himself
edifies
the [one]
however
prophesying
[the] church
edifies
I desire
now
all
you
to speak
in tongues
rather
however
that
you should prophesy
greater [is]
now
the [one]
prophesying
than
the [one]
speaking
in tongues
except
if
not
he should interpret
so that
the
church
edification
might receive
Now
however
brothers
if
I should come
to
you
in tongues
speaking
what
you
will I profit
if
not
to you
I should speak
either
in
revelation
or
in
knowledge
or
in
prophecy
or
teaching
Even
-
lifeless things
a sound
giving
whether
flute
or
harp
if
distinction
to the
sounds
not
they give
how
will it be known
what [is]
being piped
or
-
being harped
Also
for
if
indistinct
[the] trumpet
sound
gives
who
will prepare himself
for
battle
So
also
you
with
the
tongue
if
not
intelligible
speech
you give
how
will it be known
what [is]
being spoken
You will be
for
into
[the] air
speaking
So many
if
it may be
kinds
of languages
there are
in
[the] world
and
none
without meaning
If
therefore
not
I know
the
power
of the
sound
I will be
to the [one]
speaking
a foreigner
and
the [one]
speaking
to
me
a foreigner
So
also
you
since
zealous
you are
of spiritual gifts
for
the
edification
of the
church
search
that
you should cause [it] to abound
Therefore
the [one]
speaking
in a tongue
let him pray
that
he might interpret
If
for
I pray
in a tongue
the
spirit
of me
prays
-
but
the mind
of me
unfruitful
is
What
then
is it
I will pray
with the
spirit
I will pray
however
also
with the
mind
I will sing praise
with the
spirit
I will sing praise
however
also
with the
mind
Otherwise
if
you bless
spirit
the [one]
filling
the
place
of the
uninstructed
how
will he say
the
Amen
at
-
your
thanksgiving
since
what
you say
not
he knows
You
truly
for
well
are giving thanks
but
the
other
not
is edified
I thank
-
God
than all
of you
more
in tongues
speaking
but
in
[the] church
I desire
five
words
with
[the] mind
of me
to speak
that
also
others
I might instruct
rather than
ten thousand
words
in
a tongue
Brothers
not
children
be
in the
minds
Yet
in the
evil
be little children
in the
however
thinking
full grown
be
In
the
law
it has been written
-
By
other tongues
and
by
lips
other
I will speak
to the
people
this
and
not even
thus
will they hear
Me
says
[the] Lord
So then
-
tongues
for
a sign
are
not
to those
believing
but
to the
unbelieving
-
but
prophecy
[is] not
to the
unbelieving
but
to the
believing
If
therefore
gathers
the
church
whole
together
the
place
and
all
should speak
in tongues
come in
however
uninstructed ones
or
unbelievers
not
will they say
that
you are mad
If
however
all
prophesy
should come in
then
some
unbeliever
or
uninstructed
he is convicted
by
all
he is examined
by
all
the
secrets
of the
heart
of him
manifest
become
And
thus
having fallen
upon
[his] face
he will worship
-
God
declaring
that
certainly
-
God
among
you
is
What
then
is it
brothers
When
you may come together
each
a psalm
has
a teaching
has
a revelation
has
a tongue
has
an interpretation
has
All things
for
edification
let be done
If
with a tongue
anyone
speaks
[let it be] by
two
or
the
most
three
and
in
turn
and
one
let interpret
If
however
not
there is
an interpreter
let him be silent
in
[the] church
to himself
then
let him speak
and
-
to God
Prophets
then
two
or
three
let speak
and
the
others
let discern
If
however
to another
a revelation should be made
sitting by
the
first
let be silent
You are able
for
[one] by
one
all
to prophesy
so that
all
may learn
and
all
may be exhorted
And
spirits
of prophets
to prophets
are subject
Not
for
He is
of disorder
the
God
but
of peace
As
in
all
the
churches
of the
saints
the
women
in
the
churches
let them be silent
Not
for
it is allowed
to them
to speak
but
to be in submission
as
also
the
law
says
If
however
anything
to learn
they desire
at
home
the
own
husbands
let them ask
shameful
for
it is
for a woman
to speak
in
[the] church
Or
from
you
the
word
-
of God
has gone out
Or
to
you
only
has it come
If
anyone
considers
a prophet
himself to be
or
spiritual
let him recognize
the things
I write
to you
that
of [the] Lord
are
[the] commands
If
however
anyone
is ignorant
let him be ignored
So
brothers
of me
earnestly desire
-
to prophesy
and
-
to speak
not
do forbid
in tongues
All things
however
properly
and
with
order
let be done
I make known
now
to you
brothers
the
gospel
that
I proclaimed
to you
which
also
you received
in
which
also
you stand
by
which
also
you are being saved
to the
word
I proclaimed
to you
if
you hold fast
unless
if
not
in vain
you have believed
I delivered
for
to you
in
the foremost
what
also
I received
that
Christ
died
for
the
sins
of us
according to
the
Scriptures
and
that
He was buried
and
that
He was raised
the
day
the
third
according to
the
Scriptures
and
that
He appeared
to Cephas
then
to the
Twelve
Thereafter
He appeared
to more than
five hundred
brothers
at once
of
whom
the
greater part
remain
until
now
some
however
have fallen asleep
Then
He appeared
to James
then
to the
apostles
all
Last
then
of all
as
the
untimely birth
He appeared
also to me
I
for
am
the
least
of the
apostles
who
not
am
fit
to be called
an apostle
because
I persecuted
the
church
-
of God
[By the] grace
however
of God
I am
what
I am
and
the
grace
of Him
-
toward
me
not
void
has been
Rather
more abundantly
than them
all
I toiled
not
I
however
but
the
grace
-
of God
with
me
Whether
therefore
I
or
they
thus
we preach
and
thus
you believed
If
now
Christ
is preached
that
out from
[the] dead
He has been raised
how
say
among
you
some
that
a resurrection
of [the] dead
not
there is
If
however
a resurrection
of [the] dead
not
there is
neither
Christ
has been raised
if
then
Christ
not
has been raised
[is] void
then
the
preaching
of us
void
also
the
faith
of you
We are found
then
also
false witnesses
-
of God
because
we have witnessed
concerning
-
God
that
He raised up
-
Christ
whom
not
He has raised
if
then
[the] dead
not
are raised
If
for
[the] dead
not
are raised
neither
Christ
has been raised
if
then
Christ
not
has been raised
futile
the
faith
of you
still
you are
in
the
sins
of you
Then
also
those
having fallen asleep
in
Christ
have perished
If
in
the
life
this
in
Christ
having hope
we are
only
more to be pitied
than all
men
we are
Now
however
Christ
has been raised
out from
[the] dead
firstfruit
of those
having fallen asleep
Since
for
by
a man [came]
death
also
by
a man
resurrection
of [the] dead
For as
indeed
in
-
Adam
all
die
so
also
in
-
Christ
all
will be made alive
Each
however
in
the
own
order
[the] firstfruit
Christ
then
those
of
Christ
at
the
coming
of Him
then
the
end
when
He shall hand over
the
kingdom
to the
God
and
Father
when
He shall have annulled
all
dominion
and
all
authority
and
power
It behooves
for
Him
to reign
until
that
He shall have put
all
the
enemies
under
the
feet
of Him
[The] last
enemy
to be abolished [is]
-
death
All things
for
He has put in subjection
under
the
feet
of Him
When
however
it may be said
that
all things
have been put in subjection
[it is] evident
that
[is] excepted
the [One]
having put in subjection
to Him
-
all things
When
now
shall have been put in subjection
to Him
-
all things
then
also
Himself
the
Son
will be put in subjection
to the [One]
having put in subjection
to Him
-
all things
so that
may be
-
God
all
in
all
Otherwise
what
will they do
who
are baptized
for
the
dead
If
at all
[the] dead
not
are raised
why
also
are they baptized
for
them
Why
also
we
are in danger
every
hour
Every
day
I die
as surely as
the
in you
boasting
brothers
which
I have
in
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
If
according to
man
I fought wild beasts
in
Ephesus
what
to me
the
profit
If
[the] dead
not
are raised
Let us eat
and
let us drink
tomorrow
for
we die
Not
be misled
Do corrupt
morals
good
companionships
bad
Sober up
righteously
and
not
sin
ignorance
for
of God
some
have
to
[the] shame
of you
I speak
But
will say
someone
How
are raised
the
dead
With what
then
body
do they come
Fool
you
What
you sow
not
does come to life
if
not
it dies
And
what
you sow
not
the
body
that
will be
you sow
but
a bare
grain
if
it may be
of wheat
or
of some
of the
rest
-
But
God
gives
it
a body
as
He has willed
and
to each
of the
seeds
its own
body
Not
all
flesh [is]
the
same
flesh
but
one
indeed
of men
another
now
flesh
of beasts
another
now
flesh
of birds
another
now
of fish
And
bodies [there are]
heavenly
and
bodies
earthly
But
one
truly
[is] the
of the
heavenly
glory
another
now
that
of the
earthly
One [is]
[the] glory
of [the] sun
and
another
[the] glory
of [the] moon
and
another
[the] glory
of [the] stars
star
for
from star
differs
in
glory
So
also [is]
the
resurrection
of the
dead
It is sown
in
decay
it is raised
in
immortality
It is sown
in
dishonor
it is raised
in
glory
It is sown
in
weakness
it is raised
in
power
It is sown
a body
natural
it is raised
a body
spiritual
If
there is
a body
natural
there is
also
spiritual
So
also
it has been written
Became
the
first
man
Adam
into
a soul
living
the
last
Adam
into
a spirit
life-giving
However
not
first [was]
the
spiritual
but
the
natural
then
the
spiritual
The
first
man
[was] from
[the] earth
made of dust
the
second
man
from
heaven
As
the [one]
made of dust
so
also [are]
those
of the earth
and
as
the
heavenly [one]
so
also
those
of heaven
And
as
we have born
the
image
of the
earthly
we shall bear
also
the
image
of the
heavenly
This
now
I say
brothers
that
flesh
and
blood
[the] kingdom
of God
to inherit
not
is able
nor
the
decay
the
immortality
does inherit
Behold
a mystery
to you
I tell
All
not
we will sleep
all
however
we will be changed
in
an instant
in
[the] twinkling
of an eye
at
the
last
trumpet
The trumpet will sound
for
and
the
dead
will be raised
imperishable
and
we
will be changed
It behooves
for
the
perishable
this
to put on
imperishable
and
the
mortal
this
to put on
immortality
When
now
the
perishable
this
shall have put on
imperishable
and
the
mortal
this
shall have put on
immortality
then
will come to pass
the
word
-
having been written
Has been swallowed up
-
death
in
victory
Where
of you
O death
the
victory
Where
of you
O death
the
sting
-
And
the sting
-
of death [is]
-
sin
-
and
the power
-
of sin
the
law
to
however
God
[be] thanks
the [One]
giving
us
the
victory
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
brothers
of me
beloved
steadfast
be
immovable
abounding
in
the
work
of the
Lord
always
knowing
that
the
toil
of you
not
is
in vain
in
[the] Lord
Concerning
now
the
collection
which [is]
for
the
saints
as
I have directed
the
churches
-
of Galatia
so
also
you
are to do
Every
first
of the week
each
of you
aside
him
let put
treasuring up
-
what
if
he may be prospered in
so that
not
when
I might come
then
collections
there should be
When
then
I shall have arrived
whomever
if
you might approve
with
letters
these
I will send
to carry
the
bounty
of you
to
Jerusalem
If
then
suitable
it is
for
me also
to go
with
me
they will go
I will come
however
to
you
when
Macedonia
I shall have gone through
Macedonia
for
I am going through
With
you
then
possibly
I will stay
or
even
I will winter
so that
you
me
may equip
wherever
if
I may go
Not
I want
for
you
now
in
passing
to see
I hope
indeed
a time
certain
to remain
with
you
if
the
Lord
permits
I will remain
however
in
Ephesus
until
-
Pentecost
A door
for
to me
has opened
great
and
productive
and
are opposing
many
If
now
comes
Timothy
see
that
without fear
he might be
with
you
the
for
work
of [the] Lord
he is doing
as
also I
Not
anyone
therefore
him
should despise
Equip
however
him
in
peace
so that
he might come
to
me
I am expecting
for
him
with
the
brothers
Concerning
now
Apollos
the
brother
greatly
I exhorted
him
that
he should go
to
you
with
the
brothers
and
at all
not
was
[his] will
that
now
he should come
he will come
however
when
he shall have opportunity
Watch you
stand firm
in
the
faith
act like men
be strong
All things
of you
in
love
let be done
I exhort
now
you
brothers
you know
the
house
of Stephanas
that
it is
firstfruit
-
of Achaia
and
to
service
to the
saints
they have devoted
themselves
that
also
you
be subject
-
to such as these
and
to everyone
-
joining in the work
and
laboring
I rejoice
however
at
the
coming
of Stephanas
and
Fortunatus
and
Achaicus
because
-
your
deficiency
these
have filled up
They refreshed
for
-
my
spirit
and
-
yours
Recognize
therefore
-
such as these
Greet
you
the
churches
-
of Asia
Greet
you
in
[the] Lord
heartily
Aquila
and
Prisca

Greet
you

Greet

To the
church
-
of God
-
being
in
Corinth
with
the
saints
all
-
being
in
all
-
Achaia
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
[the] Father
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
Blessed [be]
the
God
and
Father
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the
Father
-
of compassions
and
God
of all
comfort
the [One]
comforting
us
in
all
the
tribulation
of us
for
-
to be able
us
to comfort
those
in
every
tribulation
through
the
comfort
with which
we are comforted
ourselves
by
-
God
because
as
abound
the
sufferings
of the
Christ
toward
us
thus so
through
-
Christ
abounds
also
the
comfort
of us
If
however
we are constricted
[it is] for
-
your
comfort
and
salvation
if
we are encouraged
[it is] for
-
your
comfort
-
operating
in
[the] endurance
of the
same
sufferings
that
also
we
suffer
And
the
hope
of us
[is] steadfast
for
you
knowing
that
as
partners
you are
of the
sufferings
so
also
of the
comfort
Not
for
do we want
you
to be ignorant
brothers
as to
the
affliction
of us
-
having happened
in
-
Asia
that
against
excessively
beyond [our]
power
we were weighed
so as
to despair
for us
even
-
to live
But
we
in
ourselves
the
sentence
-
of death
had
in order that
not
trusting
we should be
in
ourselves
but
in
-
God
the [One]
raising
the
dead
who
from
such a great
a death
has delivered
us
and
will deliver [us]
in
whom
we have hope
that
also
still
He will deliver [us]
joining together
also
of you
for
us
by
supplication
so that
by
many
persons
for the
toward
us
grace bestowed
through
many
thanks may be given
for
us
-
For
the boasting
of us
this
is
the
testimony
of the
conscience
of us
that
in
[the] holiness
and
sincerity
-
of God
not
in
wisdom
fleshly
but
in
[the] grace
of God
we have conducted ourselves
in
the
world
more abundantly
now
toward
you
No
for
other things
we write
to you
other
than
what
you read
or
even
understand
I hope
now
that
to [the]
end
you will understand
as
also
you have understood
us
in
part
so that
boasting
of you
we are
even as
also
you [are]
ours
in
the
day
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
And
with this
-
confidence
I was planning
previously
to
you
to come
so that
a second
blessing of grace
you might have
and
through
you
to pass through
into
Macedonia
and
again
from
Macedonia
to come
to
you
and
by
you
to be set forward
to
-
Judea
Thus
therefore
purposing
not
then
-
lightness
did I use
Or
what
I purpose
according to
flesh
do I purpose
so that
there should be
with
me
-
Yes
yes
and
-
No
no
Faithful
however
-
God [is]
that
the
word
of us
-
to
you
not
was
Yes
and
No
The
-
of God
for
Son
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
among
you
by
us
having been proclaimed
by
me
and
Silvanus
and
Timothy
not
was
Yes
and
No
but
Yes
in
Him
it has always been
As many as
for
promises
of God [there are]
in
Him
[is] the
Yes
Therefore
also
in
Him
the
Amen
-
to God
[is] for
glory
by
us
The [One]
now
establishing
us
with
you
unto
Christ
and
having anointed
us
[is] God
the [One]
also
having sealed
us
and
having given
the
pledge
of the
Spirit
in
the
hearts
of us
I
however
as witness
-
God
call
upon
-
my
soul
that
sparing
you
not yet
have I come
to
Corinth
Not
that
we lord it over
your
-
faith
but
fellow workers
are
of the
joy
with you
in the
for
faith
you stand firm
I judged
for
within myself
this
-
not
again
in
grief
to
you
to come
If
for
I
grieve
you
again
who
-
is gladdening
me
if
not
the [one]
being grieved
by
me
And
I wrote
this
same thing
so that
not
having come
grief
I might have
from [those]
of whom
it behooves
me
to rejoice
trusting
in
all
you
that
-
my
joy
of all
of you
is
Out of
for
much
affliction
and
anguish
of heart
I wrote
to you
through
many
tears
not
that
you might be grieved
but
the
love
that
you might know
that
I have
more abundantly
toward
you
If
however
anyone
has caused grief
not
me
has he grieved
but
in
part
that
not
I might put it too severely
all
you
Sufficient
to
such a one
[is] the
punishment
this
which [is]
by
the
majority
so that
on the contrary
rather
for you
to forgive
and
to comfort [him]
lest
perhaps
-
by more abundant
sorrow
should be overwhelmed
-
such a one
Therefore
I exhort
you
to confirm
toward
him
love
For
this
indeed
also
did I write
so that
I might know
the
proof
of you
whether
to
everything
obedient
you are
To whomever
now
anything
you forgive
I also
and
for
I
to whom
I have forgiven
if
anything
I have forgiven
[it is] for the sake of
you
in
[the] person
of Christ
so that
not
we should be outwitted
by
-
Satan
not
for
of his
-
schemes
we are ignorant
Having come
now
to
-
Troas
for
the
gospel
-
of Christ
also
a door
to me
having been opened
in
[the] Lord
not
I had
rest
in the
spirit
of me
in the
not
finding
my
Titus
the
brother
of me
instead
having taken leave of
them
I went out
to
Macedonia
To
however
God
[be] thanks
the [One]
always
leading in triumph
us
in
-
Christ
and
the
fragrance
of the
knowledge
of Him
making manifest
through
us
in
every
place
For
of Christ
a sweet perfume
we are
-
to God
in
those
being saved
and
in
those
perishing
to one
indeed
an odor
from
death
to
death
to one
now
a fragrance
from
life
to
life
And
for
these things
who [is]
sufficient
Not
for
we are
like
the
many
peddling
the
word
-
of God
but
as
of
sincerity
but
as
of
God
before
God
in
Christ
we speak
Are we beginning
again
ourselves
to commend
Or
not
we need
like
some
commendatory
letters
to
you
or
from
you
The
letter
of us
you
are
having been inscribed
in
the
hearts
of us
being known
and
being read
by
all
men
being revealed
that
you are
a letter
of Christ
having been ministered to
by
us
having been inscribed
not
in ink
but
with [the] Spirit
of God
[the] living
not
on
tablets
of stone
but
on
tablets
of hearts
human
Confidence
now
such
we have
through
-
Christ
toward
-
God
Not
that
from
ourselves
sufficient
we are
to reckon
anything
as
of
ourselves
but
the
sufficiency
of us
[is] of
-
God
who
also
has made competent
us [as]
ministers
of a new
covenant
not
of [the] letter
but
of [the] Spirit
the
for
letter
kills
-
but
the Spirit
gives life
If
now
the
ministry
-
of death
in
letters
having been engraved
on stones
was produced
in
glory
so as for
not
to be able
to look intently
the
sons
of Israel
into
the
face
of Moses
on account of
the
glory
of the
face
of him
which
is fading
how
not
more
the
ministry
of the
Spirit
will be
in
glory
If
for
in the
ministry
-
of condemnation [was]
glory
much
more
abounds
the
ministry
-
of righteousness
[in] glory
Even
for
not
has been glorified
that
having been made glorious
in
this
-
respect
on account of
the
surpassing [it]
glory
If
for
that which
is fading away
[was] through
glory
much
more [is]
that
remaining
in
glory
Having
therefore
such
hope
great
boldness
we use
and
not
as
Moses
would put
a veil
over
the
face
of himself
for
-
not
to look intently
the
sons
of Israel
into
the
end
of that
fading away
But
were hardened
the
minds
of them
Until
for
the
present
day
the
same
veil
at
the
reading
of the
old
covenant
remains
not
being lifted
which
in
Christ
is being removed
But
unto
this day
when
-
shall be read
Moses
a veil
over
the
heart
of them
lies
Whenever
however
if
[one] shall have turned
to
[the] Lord
is taken away
the
veil
The
now
Lord
the
Spirit
is
where
now
the
Spirit
of [the] Lord [is]
[there is] freedom
We
now
all
having been unveiled
in face
the
glory
of [the] Lord
beholding as in a mirror
the
same
image
are being transformed into
from
glory
to
glory
even as
from
[the] Lord
[the] Spirit
Because of
this
having
the
ministry
this
as
we received mercy
not
we lose heart
But
we have renounced
the
hidden things
-
of shame
not
walking
in
craftiness
nor
falsifying
the
word
-
of God
but
-
by manifestation
of the
truth
commending
ourselves
to
every
conscience
of men
before
-
God
If
however
indeed
is
concealed
the
gospel
of us
to
those who
are perishing
it is
concealed
in
whom
the
god
of the
age
this
has blinded
the
minds
of the
unbelieving
so as for
-
not
to beam forth
the
illumination
of the
gospel
of the
glory
-
of Christ
who
is
[the] image
-
of God
Not
for
ourselves
do we proclaim
but
Christ
Jesus
Lord
ourselves
now
servants
of you
for the sake of
Jesus
For [it is]
-
God
-
having said
Out of
darkness
light
shall shine
who
shone
in
the
hearts
of us
for [the]
radiance
of the
knowledge
of the
glory
-
of God
in
[the] face
Christ
We have
now
the
treasure
this
in
earthen
vessels
that
the
surpassingness
of the
power
may be
-
from God
and
not
from
us
in
every [way]
being hard pressed
but
not
being crushed
being perplexed
but
not
despairing
being persecuted
but
not
being forsaken
being struck down
but
not
being destroyed
always
the
death
-
[of] Jesus
in
[our]
body
carrying around
so that
also
the
life
-
of Jesus
in
the
body
of us
should be manifested
always
for
we
the
living
to
death
are being delivered
on account of
Jesus
so that
also
the
life
-
of Jesus
may be manifested
in
the
mortal
flesh
of us
So then
-
death
in
us
works
-
but
life
in
you
Having
however
the
same
spirit
-
of faith
according to
that
having been written
I believed
therefore
I have spoken
also
we
believe
therefore
also
speak
knowing
that
the [One]
having raised up
the
Lord
Jesus
also
us
through
Jesus
will raise up
and
will present [us]
with
you
-
For
all things [are]
for the sake of
you
so that
the
grace
having abounded
through
-
more and more
the
thanksgiving
may increase
to
the
glory
-
of God
Therefore
not
we lose heart
but
if
indeed
the
outward
of us
man
is being brought to decay
yet
the
inner
of us
is being renewed
day
and
day
The
for
momentary
lightness
-
affliction
far
surpassing
to
excessiveness
an eternal
weight
of glory
is producing
for us
not
are looking at
we
the things
being seen
but
the things
not
being seen
The things
for
being seen [are]
temporary
the things
however
not
being seen
[are] eternal
We know
for
that
if
-
earthly
of us
house
the
tent
should be destroyed
a building
from
God
we have
a house
not made with hands
eternal
in
the
heavens
And
indeed
in
this
we groan
the
dwelling
of us
which [is]
from
heaven
to be clothed with
longing
If
indeed
also
having been clothed
not
naked
we will be found
And
for
-
being
in
the
tent
we groan
being burdened
because
that
not
we do wish
to be unclothed
but
to be clothed
that
may be swallowed up
the
mortal
by
-
life
The [One]
now
having prepared
us
for
very
this
[is] God
-
having given
to us
the
pledge
of the
Spirit
being confident
therefore
always
and
knowing
that
being at home
in
the
body
we are absent
from
the
Lord
by
faith
for
we walk
not
by
sight
We are confident
now
and
are pleased
rather
to be absent
out of
the
body
and
to be at home
with
the
Lord
Therefore
also
we are ambitious
whether
being at home
or
being away
well-pleasing
to Him
to be
-
For
all
of us
to be revealed
it behooves
before
the
judgment seat
-
of Christ
that
may receive back
each
the things [done]
in
the
body
according to
what
he did
whether
good
or
evil
Knowing
therefore
the
fear
of the
Lord
men
we persuade
to God
and
we have been made manifest
I hope
now
also
in
the
consciences
of you
to have been made manifest
Not
again
ourselves
are we commending
to you
but
occasion
are giving
to you
of boasting
on behalf of
us
so that
you may have [an answer]
toward
those
in
appearance
boasting
and
not
in
[the] heart
If
for
we are beside ourselves
[it is] to God
or if
we are sober-minded
[it is] for you
The
for
love
-
of Christ
compels
us
having concluded
this
that
One
for
all
has died
therefore
-
all
have died
And
for
all
He died
that
those
living
no longer
to themselves
should live
but
to the [One]
for
them
having died
and
having been raised again
Therefore
we
from
-
now
no one
regard
according to
[the] flesh
Though
even
we have regarded
according to
flesh
Christ
yet
now
no longer
we regard [Him thus]
Therefore
if
anyone
[is] in
Christ
[he is] a new
creation
The
old things
have passed away
behold
has come into being
[the] new
-
And
all things
[are] of
-
God
the [One]
having reconciled
us
to Himself
through
Christ
and
having given
to us
the
ministry
-
of reconciliation
how
that
God
was
in
Christ
[the] world
reconciling
to Himself
not
reckoning
to them
the
trespasses
of them
and
having put
into
us
the
word
-
of reconciliation
For
Christ
therefore
we are ambassadors
as though
-
God
is beseeching
through
us
We implore
on behalf
of Christ
Be reconciled
-
to God
The [One]
not
having known
sin
for
us
sin
He made
so that
we
might become
[the] righteousness
of God
in
Him
Working together
now
also
we exhort
not
in
vain
the
grace
-
of God
to receive
you
He says
for
In a time
acceptable
I listened to
you
and
in
a day
of salvation
I helped
you
Behold
now
[is the] time
of favor
behold
now
[is the] day
of salvation
Nothing
before
no one
placing
an obstacle
so that
not
should be blemished
the
ministry
rather
in
everything
we are commending
ourselves
as
Godâs
servants
in
endurance
great
in
tribulations
in
hardships
in
distresses
in
beatings
in
imprisonments
in
riots
in
labors
in
watchings
in
fastings
in
purity
in
knowledge
in
patience
in
kindness
in [the]
Spirit
Holy
in
love
genuine
in [the]
word
of truth
in [the]
power
of God
with
the
weapons
-
of righteousness
for the
right hand
and
for [the] left
through
glory
and
dishonor
through
bad report
and
good report
as
imposters
and yet
true
as
being unknown
and yet
being well-known
as
dying
and yet
behold
we live
as
being disciplined
and yet
not
being killed
as
being sorrowful
always
yet
rejoicing
as
poor
many
yet
enriching
as
nothing
having
and yet
all things
possessing
The
mouth
of us
has been opened
to
you
Corinthians
the
heart
of us
has been expanded
Not
you are restrained
by
us
you are restrained
however
in
the
affections
of you
-
Now
[as] the same
recompense
as
to children
I speak
be expanded
also
you
Not
become
unequally yoked together
with unbelievers
what
for
partnership [have]
righteousness
and
lawlessness
Or
what
fellowship
light
with
darkness
What
now
harmony
Christ
with
Belial
Or
what
part
to a believer
with
an unbeliever
What
now
agreement
[the] temple
of God
with
idols
We
for
[the] temple
of God
are
[the] living
as
has said
-
God
-
I will dwell
in
them
and
will walk among [them]
and
I will be
their
God
and
they
will be
to Me
a people
Therefore
come out
from
the midst
of them
and
be separate
says
[the] Lord
and
unclean
nothing
touch
and I
will receive
you
and
I will be
to you
for
a father
and
you
will be
to Me
for
sons
and
daughters
says
[the] Lord
Almighty
These
therefore
having
-
promises
beloved
we should cleanse
ourselves
from
every
defilement
of flesh
and
spirit
perfecting
holiness
in
[the] fear
of God
Make room for
us
no one
we have wronged
no one
we have corrupted
no one
we have exploited
For
condemnation
not
I speak
I have before said
for
that
in
the
hearts
of us
you are
for [us]
-
to die together
and
to live together
Great [is]
my
boldness
toward
you
great
my
boasting
on behalf of
you
I have been filled
-
with encouragement
I overabound
-
with joy
upon
all
the
affliction
of us
And
for
having come
of us
into
Macedonia
no
had
rest
the
flesh
of us
but
in
every [way]
we are being pressed
on the outside
conflicts
within
fears
But
the [One]
comforting
the
downcast
comforted
us
-
God
by
the
coming
of Titus
not
only
now
by
the
coming
of him
but
also
by
the
comfort
with which
he was comforted
as to
you
relating
to us
-
your
earnest desire
-
your
mourning
-
your
zeal
for
me
so as
for me
the more
to rejoice
For
if
also
I have grieved
you
in
the
letter
not
I do regret [it]
Though
even
I did regret [it]
I see
that
the
letter
that
if
even
for
an hour
grieved
you
Now
I rejoice
not
that
you were grieved
but
that
you were grieved
unto
repentance
you were grieved
for
according to
God
so that
in
nothing
you might suffer loss
through
us
The
for
according to
God
grief
repentance
to
salvation
without regret
produces
-
and
the of the
world
grief
death
produces
Behold
for
this very
same
thing
according to
God
to have been grieved
how much
has produced
in you
earnestness
but instead
reasoned defense
but
indignation
but
fear
but
longing
but
zeal
but
vindication
In
everything
you have proved
yourselves
innocent
to be
in this
matter
So
if
even
I wrote
to you
[it was] not
for the sake of
the [one]
having done wrong
nor
for the sake of
the [one]
having suffered wrong
but rather
for the sake of
-
being revealed
the
earnestness
of you
which [is]
for
us
to
you
before
-
God
On account of
this
we have been comforted
Besides
now
the
comfort
of us
the more abundantly
rather
we have rejoiced
at
the
joy
of Titus
because
has been refreshed
the
spirit
of him
by
all
of you
For
if
anything
to him
about
you
I have boasted
not
I was put to shame
but
as
all things
in
truth
we have spoken
to you
so
also
the
boasting
of us
to
Titus
truth
became
And
the
affections
of him
more abundantly
toward
you
are
remembering
the
of all
of you
obedience
how
with
fear
and
trembling
you received
him
I rejoice
that
in
everything
I am confident
in
you
We make known
now
to you
brothers
the
grace
-
of God
-
having been bestowed
among
the
churches
-
of Macedonia
that
in
much
proof
of tribulation
the
abundance
of the
joy
of them
and
-
of
deep
poverty
of them
abounded
into
the
riches
the
generosity
of them
For
according to
[their] ability
I testify [that]
and
beyond
[their] ability
[they were] willing of themselves
with
much
entreaty
imploring
of us
for the
grace
and
the
fellowship
of the
service
-
among
the
saints
And
not [only]
as
we had hoped
but
themselves
they gave
first
to the
Lord
and then
to us
by [the]
will
of God
Accordingly
-
exhorted
we
Titus
that
as
he had begun
so
also
he might complete
with
you
as well
the
grace
this
But
even as
in
every [way]
you abound
in faith
and
speech
and
knowledge
and
all
earnestness
and
in the
from
us
to
you
love
that
also
in
this
-
grace
you should abound
Not
as
a command
do I speak
but
through
the
of others
earnestness
also
the
-
of your
love
genuineness
proving
You know
for
the
grace
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
that
for the sake of
you
He became poor
rich
being
so that
you
-
through that
poverty
might be enriched
And
a judgment
in
this [matter]
I give
this
indeed
for you
is profitable
who
not
only
-
to act
but
also
-
to will
have begun
from
a year ago
Now
then
also
the
doing
complete
so that
just as
[there was] the
readiness
of the
to will
so
also
the
to complete
out of
that which
you have
If
for
the
readiness
is present
as
if
he might have
acceptable
not
as
not
he does have
Not
for
that
to others [there may be]
ease
but for you
affliction
but
of
equality
At
the
present
time
-
your
abundance
[will be] for
the
of those
need
so that
also
-
their
abundance
may be
for
the
of you
need
so that
there may be
equality
As
it has been written
He
the
much
not
did abound
and
he
the
little
not
had lack
Thanks
however
-
to God
the [One]
putting
the
same
earnestness
for
you
into
the
heart
of Titus
For
[our]
indeed
appeal
he accepted
very earnest
however
being
of his own accord
he has gone out
to
you
We have sent
now
with
him
the
brother
whose
-
praise
[is] in
the
gospel
through
all
of the
churches
not
only
now
but
also
having been chosen
by
the
churches
fellow traveler
of us
with
-
grace
this
that [is]
being administered
by
us
toward
the
himself
of the
Lord
glory
and
readiness
of us
avoiding
this
lest
anyone
us
should blame
in
the
abundance
this
-
being administered
by
us
We are taking great care to do
for
what is right
not
only
before
[the] Lord
but
also
before
men
We sent with
now
them
the
brother
of us
whom
we have proven
in
many things
often
earnest
to be
now
however
much
earnest
by [his] confidence
more
which [is]
in
you
Whether
as regards
Titus
[he is] partner
my
and
for
you
a fellow worker
or
brothers
our
[they are] apostles
of [the] churches
[the] glory
of Christ
-
Therefore
the proof
of the
love
of you
and
of our
boasting
about
you
to
them
show
in
face
of the
churches
Concerning
now
for
the
service
-
for
the
saints
superfluous
for me
it is
-
to write
to you
I know
for
the
readiness
of you
which
concerning
you
I boast of
to Macedonians
that
Achaia
has been prepared
from
a year ago
and
-
your
zeal
has been provoking
the
greater number
I have sent
however
the
brothers
that
not
the
boasting
of us
which [is]
about
you
should be made void
in
the
matter
this
that
as
I have been saying
prepared
you may be
Not
perhaps
if
should come
with
me
Macedonians
and
find
you
unprepared
would be put to shame
we
that
not
we might say
you
in
the
confidence
this
Necessary
therefore
I esteemed [it]
to exhort
the
brothers
that
they should go before
unto
you
and
should complete beforehand
the
foreannounced
blessing
of you
this
ready
to be
thus
as
a blessing
and
not
as
covetousness
This
now
The [one]
sowing
sparingly
sparingly
also
will reap
and
the [one]
sowing
upon
blessings
upon
blessings
also
will reap
each
as
he purposes
in the
heart
not
out of
regret
or
of
necessity
a cheerful
for
giver
loves
-
God
Able [is]
now
-
God
all
grace
to make abound
to
you
so that
in
every [way]
always
all
sufficiency
having
you may abound
in
every
work
good
As
it has been written
He has scattered abroad
He has given
to the
poor
the
righteousness
of Him
abides
to
the
age
The [One]
now
supplying
seed
to him
sowing
and
bread
for
food
will supply
and
will multiply
the
seed for sowing
of you
and
will increase
the
fruits
of the
righteousness
of you
in
every [way]
enriching you
to
all
generosity
which
produces
through
us
thanksgiving
-
to God
For
the
ministry
of the
service
this
not
only
is
completely filling up
the
needs
of the
saints
but
also
is overflowing
through
many
thanksgivings
-
to God
through
the
proof
of the
service
this
[they] glorifying
-
God
at
the
submission
of the
of confession
of you
to
the
gospel
-
of Christ
and
[the] generosity
of the
participation
toward
them
and
toward
all
and
their
supplication
[is] for
you
a longing
for you
on account of
the
surpassing
grace
-
of God
upon
you
Thanks [be]
-
to God
for
the
indescribable
of Him
gift
Myself
now
I
Paul
exhort
you
by
the
meekness
and
gentleness
-
of Christ
who
as to
appearance
indeed
[am] humble
among
you
being absent
however
am bold
toward
you
I implore [you]
now
that
not
being present
to be bold
with the
confidence
with which
I reckon
to be daring
toward
some
-
reckoning
us
as
according to
flesh
walking
In
flesh
for
walking
not
according to
flesh
do we wage war
The
for
weapons
of the
warfare
of us
[are] not
fleshly
but
powerful
-
divinely
to
[the] demolition
of strongholds
arguments
overthrowing
and
every
high thing
lifting itself up
against
the
knowledge
-
of God
and
taking captive
every
thought
into
the
obedience
-
of Christ
and
in
readiness
having
to avenge
all
disobedience
when
might have been fulfilled
your
-
obedience
The things
according to
appearance
are you looking
If
anyone
is persuaded
in himself
of Christ
to be
this
let him reckon
again
within
himself
that
as
he
[is] of Christ
so
also [are]
we
If
even
for
more abundantly
somewhat
I should boast
concerning
the
authority
of us
which
has given [us]
the
Lord
for
building [you] up
and
not
for
tearing down
you
not
I will be ashamed
that
not
[I] might seem
as if
-
to frighten
you
by means of
the
letters
For
the
letters
indeed
they say
[are] weighty
and
strong
-
but
the presence
of the
body
weak
and
the
speech
having been ignored
This
let reckon
-
such a one
that
such as
we are
-
in word
by
letters
being absent
such [we are]
also
being present
-
in action
Not
for
dare we
to classify
or
to compare
ourselves [with]
some
-
themselves
commending
but
these
by
themselves
themselves
measuring
and
comparing
themselves
with themselves
not
understand
We
however
not
into
the things
beyond measure
will boast
but
according to
the
measure
of the
area
that
has assigned
to us
-
God
a measure
to reach
as far as
also
you
Not
for
as
not
reaching
to
you
we are overextending
ourselves
as far as
for
also
you
we came
in
the
gospel
-
of Christ
not
to
the things
beyond measure
boasting
in
othersâ
labors
hope
however
having
increasing
the
faith
of you
among
you
to be enlarged
according to
the
area
of us
to
abundance
so as
that
beyond
you
to preach the gospel
not
in
anotherâs
area
in
things
ready
to boast
The [one]
however
boasting
in
[the] Lord
let him boast
Not
for
the [one]
himself
commending
this [one]
is
approved
but
the one whom
the
Lord
commends
I wish
you were bearing with
me
little
a
in foolishness
but
indeed
you do bear with
me
I am jealous as to
for
you
of God
with [the] jealousy
I have betrothed
for
you
to one
husband
a virgin
pure
to present
-
to Christ
I am afraid
however
lest
by any means
as
the
serpent
deceived
Eve
in
the
craftiness
of him
might be corrupted
the
minds
of you
from
the
simplicity
and
the
purity
-
in
Christ
If
indeed
for
the [one]
coming
another
Jesus
proclaims
whom
not
we did proclaim
or
a spirit
different
you receive
which
not
you did receive
or
glad tidings
different
which
not
you did accept
well
are you bearing with [it]
I reckon
for
in nothing
to have been inferior
to those
most eminent
apostles
If
however
even
unpolished
-
in speech [I am]
yet
not
-
in knowledge
but
in
every [way]
we have been made manifest
in
all things
to
you
Or
a sin
did I commit
myself
humbling
so that
you
might be exalted
because
freely
the
-
of God
gospel
I preached
to you
Other
churches
I robbed
having received
support
for
the
toward you
service
And
being present
with
you
and
having been in need
not
I did burden
no one
-
for
the need
of me
completely filled up
the
brothers
having come
from
Macedonia
and
in
everything
unburdensome
myself
to you
I kept
and
will keep
Is
[the] truth
of Christ
in
me
that
the
boasting
this
not
will be sealed up
of
mine
in
the
regions
-
of Achaia
Because of
why
Because
not
I do love
you
-
God
knows [I do]
What
however
I do
also
I will do
so that
I might cut off
the
opportunity
of those
desiring
an opportunity
that
in
what
they are boasting
they might be found
as
also
we
-
For
such [are]
false apostles
workers
deceitful
disguising themselves
as
apostles
of Christ
And
no
wonder
himself
for
-
Satan
masquerades
as
an angel
of light
[It is] not
surprising
therefore
if
also
the
servants
of him
masquerade
as
servants
of righteousness
whose
-
end
will be
according to
the
deeds
of them
Again
I say
no
one
me
should think
a fool
to be
if
however
otherwise
even
as
a fool
receive
me
that
I also
little
a
may boast
What
I am saying
not
according to
[the] Lord
am I saying
but
as
in
foolishness
in
this
the
confidence
-
of boasting
Since
many
boast
according to
the
flesh
I also
will boast
Gladly
for
you bear with
-
fools
wise
being
You bear [it]
for
if
anyone
you
enslaves
if
anyone
devours [you]
if
anyone
takes [from you]
if
anyone
exalts himself
if
anyone
in
[the] face
of you
strikes [you]
As to
dishonor
I speak
as
that
we
have been weak
In
whatever
however
-
anyone
might be daring
in
foolishness
I speak
am daring
I also
Hebrews
are they
I also
Israelites
are they
I also
Descendants
of Abraham
are they
I also
Servants
of Christ
are they
As being beside myself
I speak
above [measure]
I [too]
in
labors
more abundantly
in
imprisonments
more abundantly
in
beatings
above measure
in
deaths
often
From
[the] Jews
five times
forty [lashes]
minus
one
I received
Three times
I was beaten with rods
once
I was stoned
three times
I was shipwrecked
a night and a day
in
the
deep [sea]
I have passed
in journeyings
often
in perils
of rivers
in perils
of robbers
in perils
from [my own]
race
in perils
from
[the] Gentiles
in perils
in
[the] city
in perils
in
[the] wilderness
in perils
on
[the] sea
in perils
among
false brothers
in labor
and
toil
in
watchings
often
in
hunger
and
thirst
in
fastings
often
in
cold
and
nakedness
Besides
the things
external
the
pressure
on me
-
on every
day
[is my]
care
for all
the
churches
Who
is weak
and
not
I am weak
Who
is led into sin
and
not
I
do burn inwardly
If
to boast
it behooves [me]
[in] the things
of the
weakness
of me
I will boast
The
God
and
Father
of the
Lord
Jesus
knows
the [One]
being
blessed
to
the
ages
that
not
I am lying
In
Damascus
the
governor
under Aretas
the
king
was guarding
the
city
of the Damascenes
to seize
me
But
through
a window
in
a basket
I was let down
through
the
wall
and
I escaped
the
hands
of him
To boast
it behooves [me]
not
is it profitable
indeed
I will go on
however
to
visions
and
revelations
of [the] Lord
I know
a man
in
Christ
ago
years
fourteen
whether
in
[the] body
not
I know
or
out of
the
body
not
I know
-
God
knows
having been caught up
-
such a man
to
[the] third
heaven
And
I know
-
such
a man
whether
in
[the] body
or
out of
the
body
not
I know
-
God
knows
that
he was caught up
into
-
Paradise
and
he heard
inexpressible
words
-
not
being permitted
to man
to speak
Concerning
-
such a man
I will boast
concerning
however
myself
not
I will boast
if
not
in
the
weaknesses
If
for
I should desire
to boast
not
I will be
a fool
[the] truth
for
I will be speaking
I refrain
however
lest
anyone
to
me
should credit
more than
what
he sees
in me
or
hears
of
me
and
the
surpassingness
of the
revelations
Therefore
that
not
I should become conceited
was given
to me
a thorn
in [my]
flesh
a messenger
of Satan
that
me
he might buffet
so that
not
I should become conceited
For
this
three times
the
Lord
I begged
that
it might depart
from
me
And
He said
to me
Suffices
you
the
grace
of Me
the
for
power
in
weakness
is perfected
Most gladly
therefore
rather
will I boast
in
the
weaknesses
so that
may rest
upon
me
the
power
-
of Christ
Therefore
I take pleasure
in
weaknesses
in
insults
in
hardships
in
persecutions
and
difficulties
for
Christ
when
for
I might be weak
then
strong
I am
I have become
a fool
you
me
compelled
I
for
ought
by
you
to have been commended
In no way
for
was I inferior
to those
most eminent
apostles
though
even
nothing
I am
The
indeed
signs
of the
apostle
were performed
among
you
in
all
perseverance
in signs
both
and
wonders
and
miracles
In what
for
is it
that
you were inferior
beyond
the
rest
[of the] churches
if
not
that
myself
I
not
did burden
you
Forgive
me
the
wrong
this
Behold
third time
this
ready
I am
to come
to
you
and
not
I will burden [you]
not
for
I seek
what [is]
yours
but
you
Not
for
ought
the
children
for the
parents
to treasure up
but
the
parents
for the
children
I
now
most gladly
will spend
and
will be utterly spent
for
the
souls
of you
If
more abundantly
you
loving
less
I am loved
Be it so
however
I
not
did burden
you
but
being
crafty
by trickery
you
I caught
Not
any
of whom
I have sent
to
you
by
him
did I exploit
you
I urged
Titus [to go]
and
sent with [him]
the
brother
Not
did exploit
you
Titus
Not
in the
same
spirit
did we walk
Not
in the
same
steps
All along
have you been thinking
that
to you
we have been making a defense
Before
God
in
Christ
we speak
-
but
all things
beloved
for
-
your
edification
I fear
for
lest
perhaps
having come
not
such as
I wish
I may find
you
and I
might be found
by you
such as
not
you do wish
lest
perhaps
quarreling
jealousy
anger
contentions
slander
gossip
conceit
disorder
lest
again
having come
of me
should humble
me
the
God
of me
as to
you
and
I should mourn over
many
of those
having before sinned
and
not
having repented
of
the
impurity
and
sexual immorality
and
sensuality
that
they have practiced
Third
this [time]
I am coming
to
you
In [the]
mouth
of two
witnesses
or
three
will be established
every
matter
I have warned
and
I warn
as
being present
the
second time
and
being absent
now
those
having sinned before
and
the
rest
all
that
if
I come
to
the [same]
again
not
I will spare [anyone]
since
a proof
you seek
-
in
me
speaking
of Christ
who
toward
you
not
is weak
but
is powerful
among
you
And
for
He was crucified
in
weakness
yet
He lives
by
power
Godâs
Also
for
we
are weak
in
Him
but
we will live
with
Him
by
power
Godâs
toward
you
Yourselves
examine
whether
you are
in
the
faith
yourselves
test
Or
not
do you recognize
yourselves
that
Jesus
Christ [is]
in
you
if
not
unapproved
you are
I hope
now
that
you will know
that
we
not
are
unapproved
We pray
now
to
-
God
not
to do
you
wrong
nothing
not
that
we
approved
might appear
but
that
you
what [is]
right
may do
we
though
as
unapproved
might appear
Nothing
for
have we power
any
against
the
truth
but
for
the
truth
We rejoice
for
when
we
might be weak
you
however
strong
might be
But this
also
We pray for
the
of you
perfection
Because of
therefore
these things
being absent
I write
so that
being present
not
with severity
I should treat [you]
according to
the
authority
that
the
Lord
has given
me
for
building up
and
not
for
tearing down
Finally
brothers
rejoice
Be perfected
be exhorted
[be of] the
same
mind
be at peace
And
the
God
-
of love
and
peace
will be
with
you
Greet
one another
with
a holy
kiss
Greet
you
the
saints
all
The
grace
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
the
love
of
God
and
the
fellowship
of the
Holy

[be] with
all
of you
Paul
an apostle
not
from
men
nor
through
man
but
through
Jesus
Christ
and
God
[the] Father
the [One]
having raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
and
the
with
me
all
brothers
To the
churches
-
of Galatia
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
Father
of us
and
the Lord
Jesus
Christ
the [One]
having given
Himself
for
the
sins
of us
so that
He might deliver
us
out of
the
age
of
having come presently
evil
according to
the
will
of the
God
and
Father
of us
to whom [be]
the
glory
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
I am astonished
that
so
quickly
you are deserting
from
the [One]
having called
you
in
[the] grace
of Christ
to
a different
gospel
which
not
is
another
if
not
some
there are
who
are troubling
you
and
are desiring
to pervert
the
gospel
-
of Christ
But
even
if
we
or
an angel
out of
heaven
should preach a gospel
to you
contrary to
what
we proclaimed
to you
accursed
let him be
As
we have said before
even
now
again
I say
if
anyone
[to] you
is preaching a gospel
contrary to
what
you received
accursed
let him be
Presently
for
of men
do I seek approval
or
-
God
Or
do I seek
men
to please
For if
yet
men
I were pleasing
of Christ
a servant
not
-
I would be
I make known
for
to you
brothers
the
gospel
-
having been preached
by
me
that
not
it is
according to
man
Neither
for
I
from
man
received
it
nor
was I taught [it]
but
by
a revelation
of Jesus
Christ
You have heard of
for
-
my
way of life
former
in
-
Judaism
that
beyond
exceeding measure
I was persecuting
the
church
-
of God
and
was destroying
it
And
I was advancing
in
-
Judaism
beyond
many
contemporaries
in
the
countrymen
of me
more abundantly
zealous
being
of the
fathers
of me
traditions
When
however
was pleased
-
having selected
me
from
[the] womb
of mother
of me
and
having called [me]
by
the
grace
of Him
to reveal
the
Son
of Him
in
me
that
I might preach
Him
among
the
Gentiles
immediately
not
I consulted
with flesh
and
blood
nor
did I go up
to
Jerusalem
to
the
before
me
apostles
but
I went away
into
Arabia
and
again
returned
to
Damascus
Then
after
three
years
I went up
to
Jerusalem
to make acquaintance with
Cephas
and
I remained
with
him
days
fifteen
Other
however
of the
apostles
none
I saw
if
not
James
the
brother
of the
Lord
In what
now
I write
to you
behold
before
-
God
-
not
I lie
Then
I went
into
the
regions
-
of Syria
and
-
Cilicia
I was
then
unknown
-
by face
to the
churches
-
of Judea
that [are]
in
Christ
Only
however
hearing
they were
that
the [one]
persecuting
us
formerly
now
is preaching
the
faith
which
once
he was destroying
And
they were glorifying
in
me
-
God
Then
after
fourteen
years
again
I went up
to
Jerusalem
with
Barnabas
having taken with [me]
also
Titus
I went up
now
according to
a revelation
and
set before
them
the
gospel
that
I proclaim
among
the
Gentiles
apart
individually
however
to those
esteemed
lest
hardly
in
vain
I should be running
or
have run
But
not even
Titus
who [was]
with
me
a Greek
being
was compelled
to be circumcised
because of
even
the
brought in secretly
false brothers
who
came in by stealth
to spy out
the
freedom
of us
which
we have
in
Christ
Jesus
that
us
they will enslave
to whom
not even
for
an hour
did we yield
-
in subjection
so that
the
truth
of the
gospel
might continue
with
you
Of
now
those
esteemed
to be
something
whatsoever
formerly
they were
not
to me
makes a difference
[the] person
-
God
of a man
not
does accept
to me
for
the
esteemed
nothing
added
But
on the contrary
having seen
that
I have been entrusted with
the
gospel
of the
uncircumcision
just as
Peter [with that]
of the
circumcision
the [One]
for
having worked
in Peter
for
apostleship
of the
circumcision
did
also
in me
toward
the
Gentiles
and
having known
the
grace
-
having been given
to me
James
and
Cephas
and
John
those
esteemed
pillars
to be
[the] right hands
gave
to me
and
Barnabas
of fellowship
that
we [should go]
to
the
Gentiles
they
however
to
the
circumcision
Only [they asked]
the
poor
that
we should remember
that
also
I was eager
the same
thing
to do
When
however
came
Peter
to
Antioch
to
face
his
I opposed [him]
because
condemned
he stood
Before
-
for
came
certain ones
from
James
with
the
Gentiles
he was eating
when
however
they came
he was drawing back
and
was separating
himself
being afraid of
those
of
[the] circumcision
And
acted hypocritically
with him
also
the
rest
of [the] Jews
so that
even
Barnabas
was carried away
of them
by the
hypocrisy
But
when
I saw
that
not
they are walking uprightly
according to
the
truth
of the
gospel
I said
-
to Peter
before
all
If
you
a Jew
being
like a Gentile
and
not
like a Jew
live
why
the
Gentiles
do you compel
to Judaize
We
by birth
Jews
and
not
of
[the] Gentiles
sinners
knowing
nevertheless
that
not
is justified
a man
by
works
of law
if
not
through
faith
Christ
from Jesus
even
we
in
Christ
Jesus
have believed
that
we may be justified
by
faith
from Christ
and
not
by
works
of the Law
because
by
works
of the Law
not
will be justified
any
flesh
If
however
seeking
to be justified
in
Christ
have been found
also
we ourselves
sinners
[is] then
Christ
of sin
a minister
Never
may it be
If
for
that
I had torn down
these things
again
I build
a transgressor
myself
I prove
I
for
through
[the] Law
to [the] Law
died
that
to God
I might live


I live
now
no longer
I
lives
however
in
me
Christ
Christ that which
I have been crucified with then
now
I live
in
[the] flesh
through
faith
I live
that
from the
Son
-
of God
the [One]
having loved
me
and
having given up
Himself
for
me
Not
I do set aside
the
grace
-
of God
if
for
through
[the] Law
righteousness [is]
then
Christ
for naught
died
O
foolish
Galatians
Who
you
has bewitched
whose
before
eyes
Jesus
Christ
was publicly portrayed
[as] having been crucified
This
only
I wish
to learn
from
you
by
works
of [the] Law
the
Spirit
did you receive
or
by
hearing
of faith
So
foolish
are you
Having begun
in [the] Spirit
now
in [the] flesh
are you being perfected
So many things
did you suffer
in vain
if
indeed
also
in vain
The [One]
therefore
supplying
to you
the
Spirit
and
working
miracles
among
you
[is it] out of
works
of the Law
or
out of
hearing
of faith
So also
Abraham
believed
-
God
and
it was reckoned
to him
as
righteousness
Know
then
that
those
of
faith
these
sons
are
of Abraham
Having foreseen
then
the
Scripture
that
by
faith
justifies
the
Gentiles
-
God
foretold the gospel
-
to Abraham
-
Will be blessed
in
you
all
the
nations
So then
those
of
faith
are blessed
along with
the
believing
Abraham
As many as
for
of
works
of [the] Law
are
under
a curse
are
it has been written
for
-
Cursed [is]
everyone
who
not
does continue
all things
-
having been written
in
the
book
of the
Law
-
to do
them
That
now
by
[the] law
no one
is justified
before
-
God
[is] evident
because
The
righteous
by
faith
will live
-
And
the Law
not
is
of
faith
rather
The [one]
having done
these things
will live
by
them
Christ
us
redeemed
from
the
curse
of the
Law
having become
for
us
a curse
for
it has been written
Cursed [is]
everyone
-
hanging
on
a tree
so that
to
the
Gentiles
the
blessing
-
of Abraham
might come
in
Jesus
Christ
so that
the
promise
of the
Spirit
we might receive
through
-
faith
Brothers
according to
man
I am speaking
Even
of man
having been ratified
a covenant
no one
sets aside
or
adds thereto
-
And
to Abraham
were spoken
the
promises
and
to the
seed
of him
Not
it does say
and
-
to seeds
as
of
many
but
as
of
One
and
to the
seed
of you
who
is
Christ
This
now
I say
[The] covenant
having been confirmed beforehand
by
-
God
-
afterward
four hundred
and
thirty
years
having come
[the] law
not
does annul
so as
-
to nullify
the
promise
If
for
by
[the] Law [is]
the
inheritance
[it is] no longer
by
a promise
-
but
to Abraham
through
a promise
has granted [it]
-
God
Why
then
the
Law
-
Transgressions
on account of
it was added
until
that
should have come
the
seed
to whom
promise has been made
having been ordained
through
angels
in
[the] hand
of a mediator
-
However
a mediator
of one [person]
not
is
-
but
God
one
is
The
therefore
Law
[is] contrary to
the
promises
-
of God
Never
may it be
If
for
had been given
a law
-
being able
to impart life
indeed
from out of
[the] Law
-
would have emerged
-
righteousness
but
imprisoned
the
Scripture
things
all
under
sin
so that
the
promise
by
faith
from Jesus
Christ
might be given
to those
believing
Before
-
now
came
-
faith
under
the Law
we were held in custody
having been locked up
until
the
being about
faith
to be revealed
so that
the
Law
trainer
of us
has become
unto
Christ
so that
by
faith
we might be justified
Having come
now
-
faith
no longer
under
a trainer
we are
All
for
sons
of God
you are
through
-
faith
in
Christ
Jesus
As many as
for
into
Christ
you were baptized
Christ
you have put on
Neither
there is
Jew
nor
Greek
neither
there is
slave
nor
free
neither
there is
male
and
female
all
for
you
one
are
in
Christ
Jesus
If
now
you [are]
Christâs
then
-
Abrahamâs
seed
you are
according to
[the] promise
heirs
I say
now
for
as long as
time
the
heir
a child
is
not
he differs
from a slave
[though] owner
of everything
being
Instead
under
guardians
he is
and
trustees
until
the
time appointed
by [his]
father
So
also
we
when
we were
children
under
the
basic principles
of the
world
were
held in bondage
When
however
had come
the
fullness
of the
time
sent forth
-
God
the
Son
of him
having been born
of
a woman
having been born
under
[the] Law
that
those
under
[the] Law
He might redeem
so that
the
divine adoption as sons
we might receive
Because
now
you are
sons
sent forth
-
God
the
Spirit
of the
Son
of Him
into
the
hearts
of us
crying out
Abba
-
Father
So
no longer
you are
a slave
but
a son
if
now
a son
also
an heir
through
God
But
at that time
indeed
not
knowing
God
you were enslaved
to those
by nature
not
being
gods
now
however
having known
God
rather
however
having been known
by
God
how
do you turn
again
to
the
weak
and
destitute
principles
to which
again
anew
to be enslaved
you desire
Days
you observe
and
months
and
seasons
and
years
I fear
for you
lest
perhaps
in vain
I have toiled
for
you
Become
as
I [am]
because
I also [have become]
as
you
brothers
I implore
you
In nothing
me
have You wronged
You know
now
that
in
weakness
of the
flesh
I proclaimed the gospel
to you
at the
first
and
the
test
of you
in
the
flesh
of me
not
you did despise [me]
nor
reject [me] with contempt
but
as
an angel
of God
you received
me
even as
Christ
Jesus
What
then
the
blessedness
of you
I bear witness
for
to you
that
if
possible
the
eyes
of you
having gouged out
you would have given [them]
to me
So
enemy
of you
have I become
speaking truth
to you
They are zealous after
you
not
rightly
but
to exclude
you [from us]
They desire
so that
them
you might be zealous after
Good [it is]
now
to be zealous
in
a right [thing]
at all times
and
not
only
in
-
being present
my
with
you
Children
of me
of whom
again
I travail
until
that
shall have been formed
Christ
in
you
I was wishing
indeed
to be present
with
you
presently
and
to change
the
tone
of me
because
I am perplexed
as to
you
Tell
me
those
under
[the] Law
wishing
to be
the
Law
not
you do listen to
It has been written
for
that
Abraham
two
sons
had
one
of
the
slave woman
and
one
of
the
free
But
the [one]
indeed
of
the
slave woman
according to
flesh
has been born
the [one]
but
of
the
free
through
the
promise
which things
are
allegorized
these
for
are
two
covenants
one
indeed
from
Mount
Sinai
unto
slavery
begetting
which
is
Hagar
-
And
Hagar
Sinai
Mount
is
in
-
Arabia
she corresponds
now
to the
present
Jerusalem
she is in slavery
for
with
the
children
of her
-
But
the above
Jerusalem
free
is
who
is
mother
of us
It has been written
for
Rejoice
O barren woman
the [one]
not
bearing
break forth
and
call aloud
the [one]
not
travailing
because
many
[are] the
children
of the
desolate woman
more
than
of her
having
the
husband
You
now
brothers
like
Isaac
of promise
children
are
But
just as
at that time
the [one]
according to
flesh
having been born
was persecuting
the [one born]
according to
Spirit
so
also
[it is] now
But
what
says
the
Scripture
Cast out
the
slave woman
and
the
son
of her
no
for
not
will inherit
the
son
of the
slave woman
along with
the
son
of the
free
So then
brothers
not
we are
of [the] slave woman
children
but
of the
free
In
freedom
us
Christ
has set free
stand firm
therefore
and
not
again
in a yoke
of slavery
entangle yourselves
Behold
I
Paul
say
to you
that
if
you shall become circumcised
Christ
you
nothing
will profit
I testify
now
again
to every
man
being circumcised
that
a debtor
he is
all
the
Law
to keep
You are severed
from
Christ
whoever
in
[the] Law
are being justified
from
grace
you have fallen away
We
for
through [the] Spirit
by
faith
[the] hope
of righteousness
eagerly await
In
for
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
any
has power
nor
uncircumcision
but only
faith
through
love
working
You were running
well
Who
you
cut into
truth
not
to obey
[This]
persuasion [is]
not
of
the [One]
calling
you
A little
leaven
whole
the
lump
leavens
I
am confident
as to
you
in
[the] Lord
that
no
other
mind will you have
The [one]
however
troubling
you
will bear
the
judgment
whoever
if
he might be
I
now
brothers
if
circumcision
still
proclaim
why
still
am I persecuted
In that case
has been abolished
the
offense
of the
cross
I wish
also
will emasculate themselves
those
upsetting
you
You
for
to
freedom
were called
brothers
but
not
the
freedom
for
an opportunity
to the
flesh
Rather
through
-
love
serve
one another
-
For
the entire
Law
in
one
word
is fulfilled
in
this
You shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
If
however
one another
you bite
and
devour
take heed
lest
by
one another
you might be consumed
I say
now
by [the] Spirit
walk
and
[the] desire
[of the] flesh
no
not
you should gratify
The
for
flesh
desires
against
the
Spirit
-
and
the Spirit
against
the
flesh
these
for
to one another
are opposed
in order
not
that
if
you might wish
those things
you should do
If
however
[the] Spirit
you are led by
not
you are
under
[the] Law
Evident
now
are
the
works
of the
flesh
which
are
sexual immorality
impurity
sensuality
idolatry
sorcery
enmities
strife
jealousy
outbursts of anger
contentions
dissensions
factions
envyings
drunkennesses
carousing
and
things
like
these
as to which
I forewarn
you
even as
I warned before
that
those
such
things
doing
kingdom
Godâs
not
will inherit
-
But
the fruit
of the
Spirit
is
love
joy
peace
patience
kindness
goodness
faithfulness
gentleness
self-control
against
things
such
no
there is
law
Those
now
-
of Christ
Jesus
the
flesh
have crucified
with
[its]
passions
and
-
desires
If
we live
by [the] Spirit
by [the] Spirit
also
we should walk
Not
we should become
boastful
one another
provoking
one another
envying
Brothers
if
even
should be overcome
a man
in
some
trespass
you
the
spiritual [ones]
restore
-
such a one
in
a spirit
of gentleness
considering
yourself
lest
also
you
be tempted
One anotherâs
-
burdens
bear you
and
thus
you shall fulfill
the
law
-
of Christ
If
for
thinks [himself]
anyone
to be
something
nothing
being
he deceives
himself
-
But
the work
of himself
test
each
and
then
as to
himself
alone
the
ground of boasting
he will have
and
not
as to
-
another
Each
for
-
his own
load
shall bear
Let share
now
the [one]
being taught
in the
word
with the [one]
teaching
in
all
good things
Not
be misled
God
not
is mocked
Whatever
for
if
might sow
a man
that
also
he will reap
For
the [one]
sowing
to
the
flesh
of himself
from
the
flesh
will reap
decay
The [one]
however
sowing
to
the
Spirit
from
the
Spirit
will reap
life
eternal
-
And
[in] well
doing
not
we should grow weary
in time
for
due
we will reap a harvest
not
giving up
So
then
as
occasion
we have
we should work
-
good
toward
all
especially
now
toward
those
of the household
of the
of faith
See
in how large
to you
letters
I have written
with
my own
hand
As many as
wish
to have a fair appearance
in
[the] flesh
these
compel
you
to be circumcised
only
that
for the
cross
-
of Christ
not
they might be persecuted
Not even
for
those
being circumcised
themselves
[the] Law
keep
but
they desire
you
to be circumcised
so that
in
-
your
flesh
they may boast
For me
however
never
may it be
to boast
if
never
in
the
cross
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
through
which
to me
[the] world
has been crucified
and I
[to the] world
Neither
for
circumcision
anything
is
nor
uncircumcision
instead
a new
creation
And
as many as
those who
rule
by this
will walk
peace [be]
upon
them
and
mercy
and
upon
the
Israel
-
of God
The
henceforth
troubles
to me
no one
let give
I
for
the
marks
-
of Jesus
on
of the
body
of me
bear
The
grace
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
[be] with
the
spirit
of you
brothers
Amen
Paul
an apostle
of Christ
Jesus
by
[the] will
of God
To the
saints
-
being
in
Ephesus
and
faithful
in
Christ
Jesus
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
[the] Father
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
Blessed [be]
the
God
and
Father
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the [One]
having blessed
us
with
every
blessing
spiritual
in
the
heavenly realms
in
Christ
just as
He chose
us
in
Him
before
[the] foundation
of [the] world
to be
for us
holy
and
blameless
before
Him
in
love
having predestined
us
for
divine adoption as sons
through
Jesus
Christ
to
Himself
according to
the
good pleasure
of the
will
of Him
to
[the] praise
of [the] glory
of the
of grace
of Him
which
He has freely given
us
in
the
Beloved [One]
in
whom
we have
-
redemption
through
the
blood
of Him
the
forgiveness
-
of trespasses
according to
the
riches
of the
grace
of Him
which
He lavished
upon
us
in
all
wisdom
and
understanding
having made known
to us
the
mystery
of the
will
of Him
according to
the
pleasure
of Him
which
He purposed
in
Him
for
[the] administration
of the
fullness
of the
times
to bring together
the
all things
in
-
Christ
the things
in
the
heavens
and
the things
upon
the
earth
in
Him
in
whom
also
we have obtained an inheritance
having been predestined
according to
[the] purpose
of the [One]
-
all things
working
according to
the
counsel
of the
will
of Him
for
-
to be
us
to
[the] praise
of [the] glory
of Him
the [ones]
having first trusted
in
-
Christ
in
whom
also
you
having heard
the
word
-
of truth
the
gospel
of the
salvation
of you
in
whom
also
having believed
you were sealed
with the
Spirit
-
of promise
-
Holy
who
is
[the] guarantee
of the
inheritance
of us
to
[the] redemption
of the
acquired possession
to
[the] praise
of the
glory
of Him
Because of
this
I also
having heard of
the
among
you
faith
in
the
Lord
Jesus
and
the
love
-
toward
all
the
saints
not
do cease
giving thanks
for
you
mention
making
in
the
prayers
of me
that
the
God
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the
Father
-
of glory
may give
to you
[a] spirit
of wisdom
and
revelation
in
[the] knowledge
of Him
being enlightened
the
eyes
of the
heart
of you
in order for
-
to know
you
what
is
the
hope
of the
calling
of Him
what
[are] the
riches
of the
glory
of the
inheritance
of Him
in
the
saints
and
what
[is] the
surpassing
greatness
of the
power
of Him
toward
us
those
believing
according to
the
working
of the
might
of the
strength
of Him
which
He worked
in
-
Christ
having raised
Him
out from
[the] dead
and
having set [Him]
at
[the] right hand
of Him
in
the
heavenly realms
above
every
principality
and
authority
and
power
and
dominion
and
every
name
being named
not
only
in
the
age
this
but
also
in
the [one]
coming
And
all things
He put
under
the
feet
of Him
and
Him
gave
[to be] head
over
all things
to the
church
which
is
the
body
of Him
the
fullness
of the [One]
-
all
in
all
filling
And
you
being
dead
in the
trespasses
and
the
sins
of you
in
which
once
you walked
according to
the
age
the
world
of this
according to
the
ruler
of the
authority
of the
air
the
spirit
-
now
working
in
the
sons
-
of disobedience
among
whom
also
we
all
lived
once
in
the
desires
of the
flesh
of us
doing
the
things willed
of the
flesh
and
of [its]
thoughts
and
we were
children
by nature
of wrath
as
even
the
rest
-
But
God
rich
being
in
mercy
because of
the
great
love
of Him
with which
He loved
us
even
being
we
dead
-
in trespasses
made [us] alive with
-
Christ
by grace
you are
saved
and
He raised [us] up together
and
seated [us] together
in
the
heavenly realms
in
Christ
Jesus
in order that
He might show
in
the
ages
that
[are] coming
the
surpassing
riches
of the
grace
of Him
in
kindness
toward
us
in
Christ
Jesus
-
For
by grace
you are
saved
through
faith
and
this
not
of
yourselves
[it is] of God
the
gift
not
as a result of
works
so that
not
anyone
may boast
Of Him
for
we are
workmanship
having been created
in
Christ
Jesus
for
works
good
which
prepared beforehand
-
God
that
in
them
we should walk
Therefore
remember
that
formerly
you
the
Gentiles
in
[the] flesh
the ones
being called
[the] uncircumcision
by
that
being called
[the] circumcision
in
[the] flesh
made by hands
that
you were
at the
time
that
separate from
Christ
alienated from
the
commonwealth
-
of Israel
and
strangers
to the
covenants
of the
promise
hope
not
having
and
without God
in
the
world
Now
however
in
Christ
Jesus
you
the [ones]
once
being
far off
have become
near
by
the
blood
-
of Christ
He Himself
for
is
the
peace
of us
-
having made
-
both
one
and
the
barrier
of the
fence
having broken down
the
hostility
in
the
flesh
of Him
the
law
-
of commandments
in
ordinances
having annulled
so that
the
two
He might create
in
Himself
into
one
new
man
making
peace
and
He might reconcile
-
both
in
one
body
-
to God
through
the
cross
having slain
the
hostility
by
it
And
having come
He proclaimed the gospel
peace
to you
the [ones]
far off
and
peace
to those
near
For
through
Him
we have
the
access
-
both
by
one
Spirit
to
the
Father
So
then
no longer
are you
strangers
and
aliens
but
are
fellow citizens
of the
saints
and
of the household
-
of God
having been built
upon
the
foundation
of the
apostles
and
prophets
being
[the] cornerstone
Himself
Christ
Jesus
in
whom
the whole
building
being fitted together
is increasing
into
a temple
holy
in
[the] Lord
in
whom
also
you
are being built together
for
a habitation
-
of God
in
[the] Spirit
Of this
for reason
I
Paul
the
prisoner
-
of Christ
Jesus
for
you
-
Gentiles
If
indeed
you have heard of
the
administration
of the
grace
-
of God
-
having been given
to me
toward
you
that
by
revelation
He made known
to me
the
mystery
just as
I have written before
in
brief
by
which
you are able
reading [it]
to understand
the
insight
of me
into
the
mystery
-
of Christ
which
in other
generations
not
was made known
to the
sons
-
of men
as
now
it has been revealed
to
holy
apostles
His
and
prophets
in
[the] Spirit
are
the
Gentiles
joint-heirs
and
a joint-body
and
joint-partakers
of the
promise
in
Christ
Jesus
through
the
gospel
of which
I became
servant
according to
the
gift
of the
grace
-
of God
-
having been given
to me
according to
the
working
of the
power
of Him
To me
the
very least
of all
saints
was given
the
grace
this
to the
Gentiles
to preach
the
unsearchable
riches
-
of Christ
and
to enlighten
what [is]
the
administration
of the
mystery
-
having been hidden
from
the
ages
in
-
God
the [One]
-
all things
having created
so that
should be made known
now
to the
rulers
and
the
authorities
in
the
heavenly realms
through
the
church
the
manifold
wisdom
-
of God
according to
[the] purpose
of the
ages
which
He accomplished
in
-
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
in
whom
we have
-
boldness
and
access
in
confidence
by
the
faith
from Him
Therefore
I implore [you]
not
to lose heart
at
the
tribulations
of me
for
you
which
is
glory
of you
... of this
for reason
I bow
the
knees
of me
to
the
Father
from
whom
every
family
in
[the] heavens
and
on
earth
is named
that
He might give
you
according to
the
riches
of the
glory
of Him
with power
to be strengthened
by
the
Spirit
of Him
in
the
inner
man
[for] to dwell
-
Christ
through
-
faith
in
the
hearts
of you
in
love
being rooted
and
being founded
so that
you may be fully able
to comprehend
with
all
the
saints
what [is]
the
breadth
and
length
and
height
and
depth
to know
then
the
surpassing
-
knowledge
love
-
of Christ
so that
you may be filled
unto
all
the
fullness
-
of God
To the [One]
now
being able
above
all things
to do
exceedingly
that
we ask
or
think
according to
the
power
-
working
in
us
to Him [be]
the
glory
in
the
church
and
in
Christ
Jesus
to
all
the
generations
of the
age
of the
ages
Amen
Exhort
therefore
you
I
the
prisoner
in
[the] Lord
worthily
to walk
of the
calling
to which
you were called
with
all
humility
and
gentleness
with
patience
bearing with
one another
in
love
being diligent
to keep
the
unity
of the
Spirit
in
the
bond
-
of peace
one
body
and
one
Spirit
just as
also
you were called
into
one
hope
of the
calling
of you
one
Lord
one
faith
one
baptism
one
God
and
Father
of all
who [is]
over
all
and
through
all
and
in
all
One
now
to each
of us
has been given
-
grace
according to
the
measure
of the
gift
-
of Christ
Therefore
it says
Having ascended
on
high
He led captive
captivity
gave
gifts
-
to men
-
And
He ascended
what
is
if
not
that
also
He descended
into
the
lower
regions
of the
earth
The [One]
having descended
the same
is
also
[one]
having ascended
above
all
the
heavens
so that
He might fill
-
all things
And
He
gave
some
indeed
[to be] apostles
some
now
prophets
some
now
evangelists
some
now
shepherds
and
teachers
toward
the
perfecting
of the
saints
for
[the] work
of ministry
for
[the] building up
of the
body
-
of Christ
until
we may attain
-
all
to
the
unity
of the
faith
and
of the
knowledge
of the
Son
-
of God
unto
a man
a complete
to
[the] measure
of [the] stature
of the
fullness
-
of Christ
so that
no longer
we might be
infants
being tossed by waves
and
being carried about
by every
wind
-
of teaching
in
the
cunning
-
of men
in
craftiness
with a view to
the
scheming
-
of deceit
Speaking the truth
however
in
love
we should grow up
into
Him
in
all things
who
is
the
head
Christ
from
whom
all
the
body
being joined together
and
being held together
by
every
ligament
of [its]
supply
according to
[the] working
in
[the] measure
individual
of each
part
the
increase
of the
body
makes for itself
to
[the] building up
of itself
in
love
This
therefore
I say
and
testify
in
[the] Lord
No longer
[are] you
to walk
as
also
the
Gentiles
are walking
in
[the] futility
of the
mind
of them
being darkened
in the
understanding
being
alienated from
the
life
-
of God
because of
the
ignorance
-
being
in
them
on account of
the
hardness
of the
heart
of them
who
having cast off all feeling
themselves
have given up
to
sensuality
for
[the] working
of impurity
all
with
greediness
You
however
not
this way
learned
-
Christ
if
indeed
Him
you have heard
and
in
Him
have been taught
just as
is
[the] truth
in
-
Jesus
Are to have put off
you
concerning
the
former
way of life
the
old
man
which
is being corrupted
according to
[its]
desires
-
of deceit
to be renewed
then
in the
spirit
of the
mind
of you
and
to have put on
the
new
man
-
according to
God
having been created
in
righteousness
and
holiness
-
of truth
Therefore
having put off
-
falsehood
let speak
truth
each one
with
the
neighbor
of him
because
we are
of one another
members
Be angry
and yet
not
sin
The
sun
not
let set
upon
anger
of you
neither
give
opportunity
to the
devil
The [one]
stealing
no longer
let him steal
rather
however
let him toil
working
with the
own
hands
what
[is] good
so that
he may have [something]
to impart
to the [one]
need
having
Any
word
unwholesome
out of
the
mouth
of you
not
let go forth
but
if
any
good
for
edification
of the
need
so that
it may give
grace
to those
hearing
And
not
grieve
the
Spirit
-
Holy
-
of God
in
whom
you were sealed
for
[the] day
of redemption
All
bitterness
and
rage
and
anger
and
clamor
and
slander
let be removed
from
you
along with
all
malice
Be
now
to
one another
kind
tender-hearted
forgiving
each other
as
also
-
God
in
Christ
forgave
you
Be
therefore
imitators
-
of God
as
children
beloved
and
walk
in
love
just as
also
-
Christ
loved
us
and
gave up
himself
for
us
[as] an offering
and
a sacrifice
-
to God
into
an aroma
of a sweet smell
Sexual immorality
however
and
impurity
all
or
covetousness
not even
let be named
among
you
as also
is proper
to saints
and
filthiness
and
foolish talking
or
crude joking
which
not
are fitting
but
rather
thanksgiving
This
for
you know
realizing
that
any
fornicator
or
unclean person
or
covetous man
who
is
an idolater
not
has
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
-
of Christ
and
of God
No one
you
let deceive
with empty
words
because of
these things
for
comes
the
wrath
-
of God
upon
the
sons
-
of disobedience
Not
therefore
be
partakers
with them
You were
for
once
darkness
now
however
light
in
[the] Lord
as
children
of light
walk
-
for
the fruit
of the
light [is]
in
all
goodness
and
righteousness
and
truth
discerning
what
is
well-pleasing
to the
Lord
And
not
have fellowship with
the
works
-
unfruitful
-
of darkness
rather
however
even
expose [them]
the things
for
in secret
being done
by
them
shameful
it is
even
to mention
-
But
everything
being exposed
by
the
light
is made visible
everything
for
-
becoming visible
light
is
Therefore
it says
Awake you
the [one]
sleeping
and
rise up
out from
the
dead
and
will shine upon
you
-
Christ
Take heed
therefore
carefully
how
you walk
not
as
unwise
but
as
wise
redeeming
the
time
because
the
days
evil
are
Because of
this
not
be
foolish
but
understand
what
the
will
of the
Lord [is]
And
not
to be drunk
with wine
in
which
is
debauchery
Instead
be filled
with
[the] Spirit
speaking
to each other
psalms
and
hymns
and
songs
spiritual
singing
and
making melody
in the
heart
of you
to the
Lord
giving thanks
at all times
for
all things
in
[the] name
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
to the
God
and
Father
Be submitting yourselves
to one another
in
reverence
of Christ
-
wives
to the
own
husbands
as
to the
Lord
for
[the] husband
is
head
of the
wife
as
also
-
Christ
[is the] head
of the
church
He Himself
Savior
of the
body
But
even as
the
church
is subjected
-
to Christ
so
also
-
wives
to the own
husbands
in
everything
-
Husbands
love
the
wives
just as
also
-
Christ
loved
the
church
and
Himself
gave up
for
her
so that
her
He might sanctify
having cleansed [her]
by the
washing
-
of water
by
[the] word
so that
might present
He
to Himself
in glory
the
church
not
having
spot
or
wrinkle
or
any
of the
such things
but
that
it would be
holy
and
blameless
So
ought
also
-
husbands
to love
the
of themselves
wives
as
the
of themselves
bodies
The [one]
loving
the
of himself
wife
himself
loves
No one
for
at any time
the
of himself
flesh
hated
but
he nourishes
and
cherishes
it
just as
also [does]
-
Christ
the
church
for
members
we are
of the
body
of Him
Because of
this
will leave
a man
his
father
and
-
mother
and
be joined
to
the
wife
of him
and
will be
the
two
into
flesh
one
The
mystery
this
great
is
I
however
speak
as to
Christ
and
as to
the
church
However
also
you
-
according to
individual
each
the
of himself
wife
so
let love
as
himself
-
and
the wife
that
she may respect
the
husband
-
Children
obey
the
parents
of you
in
[the] Lord
this
for
is
right
Honor
the
Father
of you
and
-
mother
which
is
[the] commandment
first
with
a promise
that
well
with you
it may be
and
you will be
long-lived
upon
the
earth
And
-
fathers
not
provoke
the
children
of you
but
bring up
them
in
[the] discipline
and
admonition
of [the] Lord
-
Slaves
obey
the
according to
flesh
masters
with
fear
and
trembling
in
sincerity
of the
heart
of you
as
to
Christ
not
with
eye-service
as
men-pleasers
but
as
servants of
Christ
doing
the
will
-
of God
from
[the] heart
with
good will
rendering service
as
to the
Lord
and
not
to men
knowing
that
each one
if
whatever
he might have done
good
this
he will receive [back]
from
[the] Lord
whether
slave
or
free
And
-
masters
the same things
them
do
toward
them
giving up
the
threatening
knowing
that
also
of them
and
of you
the
master
is
in
[the] heavens
and
partiality
not
there is
with
Him
-
Henceforth
be empowered
in
[the] Lord
and
in
the
strength
of the
might
of Him
Put on
the
complete armor
-
of God
for
-
to be able
you
to stand
against
the
schemes
of the
devil
because
not
is
to us
the
wrestling
against
blood
and
flesh
but
against
the
rulers
against
the
authorities
against
the
cosmic powers
of the
darkness
this
against
the
spiritual [forces]
-
of evil
in
the
heavenly realms
Because of
this
take up
the
complete armor
-
of God
so that
you may be able
to withstand
in
the
day
-
evil
and
all things
having done
to stand
Stand
therefore
having girded
the
loins
of you
with
truth
and
having put on
the
breastplate
-
of righteousness
and
having shod
the
feet
with
[the] readiness
of the
gospel
-
of peace
besides
all
having taken up
the
shield
-
of faith
with
which
you will be able
all
the
arrows
of the
evil one
-
flaming
to quench
And
the
helmet
-
of salvation
take
and
the
sword
of the
Spirit
which
is
[the] word
of God
through
all
prayer
and
supplication
praying
in
every
season
in
[the] Spirit
and
unto
this very thing
watching
with
all
perseverance
and
supplication
for
all
-
saints
and also
for
me
that
to me
may be given
divine utterance
in
[the] opening
of the
mouth
of me
with
boldness
to make known
the
mystery
of the
gospel
for
which
I am an ambassador
in
a chain
that
in
it
I may be bold
as
it behooves
me
to speak
That
now
may know
also
you
the things
concerning
me
what
I am doing
all things
will make known
to you
Tychicus
the
beloved
brother
and
faithful
servant
in
[the] Lord
whom
I have sent
to
you
for
this very
purpose
that
you may know
the things
concerning
us
and
he may encourage
the
hearts
of you
Peace
to the
brothers
and
love
with
faith
from
God
[the] Father
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
-
Grace
[be] with
all
those
loving
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
in
incorruptibility
Paul
and
Timothy
servants
of Christ
Jesus
To all
the
saints
in
Christ
Jesus
-
being
in
Philippi
with
[the] overseers
and
deacons
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
Father
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
I thank
the
God
of me
upon
every
-
remembrance
of you
always
in
every
supplication
of me
for
all
of you
with
joy
the
supplication
making
for
the
partnership
of you
in
the
gospel
from
the
first
day
until
-
now
being persuaded of
[the] very thing
this
that
the [One]
having begun
in
you
a work
good
will complete [it]
until
[the] day
of Christ
Jesus
Accordingly
it is
right
for me
this
to feel
about
all
of you
since
-
have
I
in
the
heart
you
in
both
the
chains
of me
and
in
the
defense
and
confirmation
of the
gospel
fellow partakers
with me
of
grace
all
you
are
Witness
for
my
-
God [is]
how
I long after
all
you
in
[the] affection
of Christ
Jesus
And
this
I pray
that
the
love
of you
yet
more
and
more
may abound
in
knowledge
and
all
discernment
for
-
to approve
you
the things
being excellent
so that
you may be
pure
and
blameless
unto
[the] day
of Christ
being filled
with [the] fruit
of righteousness
that [is]
through
Jesus
Christ
to
[the] glory
and
praise
of God
To know
now
you
I want
brothers
that
the things
concerning
me
really
to
[the] advancement
of the
gospel
have turned out
so as for
the
chains
of me
clearly known
in
Christ
to have become
in
all
the
palace guard
and
to the
rest
all
and
-
most
of the
brothers
in
[the] Lord
trusting
by the
chains
of me
more abundantly
to dare
fearlessly
the
word
of
God
to speak
Some
indeed
even
from
envy
and
strife
some
however
also
from
goodwill
-
Christ
are proclaiming
the [ones]
indeed
out of
love
knowing
that
for
defense
of the
gospel
I am appointed
the [ones]
however
out of
selfish ambition
-
Christ
are proclaiming
not
purely
supposing
tribulation
to add
to the
chains
of me
What
then
Only
that
in every
way
whether
in pretext
or
in truth
Christ
is proclaimed
And
in
this
I rejoice
Yes
and
I will rejoice
I know
for
that
this
for me
will turn out
to
deliverance
through
-
your
prayer
and
[the] provision
of the
Spirit
of Jesus
Christ
according to
the
earnest expectation
and
hope
of me
that
in
nothing
I will be ashamed
but
in
all
boldness
as
always
also
now
will be magnified
Christ
in
the
body
of me
whether
by
life
or
by
death
To me
for
-
to live
[is] Christ
and
-
to die
[is] gain
If [I am]
however
-
to live
in
flesh
this
for me
[is the] fruit
of labor
And
what
shall I choose
Not
I know
I am pressed
however
between
the
two
the
desire
having
for [myself]
-
to depart
and
with
Christ
to be
very much
for
more
better
-
but
to remain
the
flesh
[is] more necessary
for the sake of
you
And
this
having been persuaded of
I know
that
I will remain
and
will continue with
all
of you
for
-
your
progress
and
joy
of the
faith
so that
the
boasting
of you
may abound
to
Christ
Jesus
in
me
through
-
my
coming
again
to
you
Only
worthily
of the
gospel
-
of Christ
conduct yourselves
so that
whether
having come
and
having seen
you
or
being absent
I might hear
the things
concerning
you
that
you are standing firm
in
one
spirit
with one
mind
striving together
for the
faith
of the
gospel
and
not
being frightened
in
nothing
by
those
opposing [you]
which
is
to them
a demonstration
of destruction
to you
however
of salvation
and
this
from
God
For
to you
it has been granted
-
concerning
Christ
not
only
-
in
Him
to believe
but
also
-
concerning
Him
to suffer
the
same
conflict
having
such as
you saw
in
me
and
now
hear of
in
me
If [there is]
any
therefore
encouragement
in
Christ
if
any
comfort
of love
if
any
fellowship
of [the] Spirit
if
any
affections
and
compassions
fulfill
my
-
joy
so that
the
same
you may be minded
the
same
love
having
united in soul
the
same thing
minding
nothing
according to
self-interest
or
according to
vain conceit
but
-
in humility
one another
be esteeming
surpassing
themselves
not
the things
of themselves
each
considering
but
also
the things
of others
each
This
let mind be
in
you
which
also
in
Christ
Jesus [was]
Who
in
[the] form
of God
existing
not
something to be grasped
considered
-
to be
equal
with God
but
Himself
emptied
[the] form
of a servant
having taken
in
[the] likeness
of men
having been made
And
in appearance
having been found
as
a man
He humbled
Himself
having become
obedient
unto
death
[the] death
even
of [the] cross
Therefore
also
-
God
Him
highly exalted
and
granted
to Him
the
name
-
above
every
name
that
at
the
name
of Jesus
every
knee
should bow
in the heavens
and
on earth
and
under the earth
and
every
tongue
should confess
that
[is] Lord
Jesus
Christ
to
[the] glory
of God
[the] Father
Therefore
beloved
of me
just as
always
you have obeyed
not
as
in
the
presence
of me
only
but
now
much
more
in
the
absence
of me
with
fear
and
trembling
-
your own
salvation
work out
God
for
is
the [One]
working
in
you
both
-
to will
and
-
to work
according to
[His]
good pleasure
All things
do
without
murmurings
and
disputings
so that
you may be
blameless
and
innocent
children
of God
unblemished
in [the] midst
of a generation
crooked
and
perverted
among
whom
you shine
as
lights
in
[the] world
[the] word
of life
holding forth
unto
a boast
to me
in
[the] day
of Christ
that
not
in
vain
I did run
nor
in
vain
toil
But
if
even
I am being poured out as a drink offering
on
the
sacrifice
and
service
of the
faith
of you
I am glad
and
rejoice with
all
you
-
And
likewise
also
you
be glad
and
rejoice with
me
I hope
however
in
[the] Lord
Jesus
Timothy
soon
to send
to you
that
I also
may be encouraged
having known
the things
concerning
you
No one
for
I have
like-minded
who
genuinely
the things
relative to
you
will care for
Those
all
for
the things
of themselves
are seeking
not
the things
of Christ
Jesus
-
But
the proven worth
of him
you know
that
as
a father [with]
a child
with
me
he has served
in
the
gospel
Him
indeed
therefore
I hope
to send
when
-
I shall have seen
the things
concerning
me
immediately
I am persuaded
now
in
[the] Lord
that
also
I myself
soon
I will come
Necessary
now
I esteemed [it]
Epaphroditus
the
brother
and
fellow worker
and
fellow soldier
of me
of you
now
messenger
and
minster
of the
need
of me
to send
to
you
since
longing after
he was
all
you
and
being deeply distressed
because
you heard
that
he was ill
And
indeed
he was sick
nearly
unto death
but
-
God
had mercy on
him
not
on him
now
alone
but
also
on me
that
not
sorrow
upon
sorrow
I should have
All the more speedily
therefore
I have sent
him
that
having seen
him
again
you may rejoice
and I
less anxious
might be
Receive
therefore
him
in
[the] Lord
with
all
joy
and
-
such
in honor
hold
because
for the sake of
the
work
of Christ
unto
death
he came near
having disregarded
[his]
life
so that
he might fill up
the
of you
deficit
of
toward
me
service
-
Finally
brothers
of me
rejoice
in
[the] Lord
The
same things
to write
to you
to me
indeed
[is] not
troublesome
for you
now
[is] safe
Beware of
the
dogs
beware of
the
evil
workers
beware of
the
false circumcision
We
for
are
the
circumcision
those
in [the] Spirit
of God
worshiping
and
glorying
in
Christ
Jesus
and
not
in
[the] flesh
having put confidence
though
I
have
confidence
even
in
[the] flesh
If
any
thinks
other
to have confidence
in
[the] flesh
I
more
circumcision
on [the] eighth day
of
[the] nation
of Israel
of [the] tribe
of Benjamin
a Hebrew
of
Hebrews
according to
[the] Law
a Pharisee
according to
zeal
persecuting
the
church
according to
righteousness
which [is]
in
[the] Law
having become
faultless
But
whatever things
were
to me
gain
these
I have esteemed
because of
-
Christ
loss
But
-
therefore
indeed
also
I count
all things
loss
to be
because of
the
excelling
-
knowledge
of Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of me
because of
whom
-
all things
I have lost
and
esteem [them]
rubbish
that
Christ
I may gain
and
be found
in
Him
not
having
my own
righteousness
which [is]
of
[the] Law
but
that
through
faith
from Christ
the
of
God
righteousness
on the basis of
-
faith
-
to know
Him
and
the
power
of the
resurrection
of Him
and
fellowship
sufferings
of Him
being conformed
to the
death
of Him
if
by any means
I may attain
to
the
resurrection
-
out from
dead
Not
that
already
I have obtained [it]
or
already
have been perfected
I am pursuing
however
if
also
I may lay hold
of
that for which
also
I was laid hold of
by
Christ
Jesus
Brothers
I
myself
not
do consider
to have taken hold [of it]
One thing
however
The things
indeed
behind
forgetting
to the things
now
ahead
reaching forward
toward
[the] goal
I press on
for
the
prize
of the
upward
calling
-
of God
in
Christ
Jesus
As many as
therefore
[are] mature
this
should be of mind
and
if [in]
anything
differently
you are minded
even
this
-
God
to you
will reveal
Nevertheless
to
that which
we have attained
by the
same
to walk
Imitators together
of me
be
brothers
and
observe
those
thus
walking
as
you have
[for] a pattern
us
Many
for
are walking
[of] whom
often
I told
you
now
indeed
even
weeping
I say
-
[as] enemies
of the
cross
-
of Christ
whose
-
end [is]
destruction
whose
-
God [is]
the
belly
and
-
glory
[is] in
the
shame
of them
those
things
earthly
minding
Of us
for
the
citizenship
in
[the] heavens
exists
from
whence
also
a Savior
we are awaiting
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
who
will transform
the
body
-
of humiliation
of us
conformed
to the
body
of the
glory
of Himself
according to
the
working
-
enabling
Him
even
to subdue
to Himself
-
all things
Therefore
brothers
of me
beloved
and
longed for
[the] joy
and
crown
of me
in this way
stand firm
in
[the] Lord
beloved
Euodia
I exhort
and
Syntyche
I exhort
the
same
to be of mind
in
[the] Lord
Yes
I ask
also
you
true
yokefellow
help
these [women]
who
in
the
gospel
labored together
with me
with
also
Clement
and
the
rest
of [the] fellow workers
of me
whose
-
names [are]
in
[the] book
of life
Rejoice
in
[the] Lord
always
again
I will say
rejoice
The
gentleness
of you
let be known
to all
men
The
Lord
[is] near
Nothing
be anxious about
but
in
everything
by
prayer
and
-
supplication
with
thanksgiving
the
requests
of you
let be made known
to
-
God
And
the
peace
-
of God
-
surpassing
all
understanding
will guard
the
hearts
of you
and
the
minds
of you
in
Christ
Jesus
-
Finally
brothers
whatever
is
true
whatever
venerable
whatever
right
whatever
pure
whatever
lovely
whatever
admirable
if
any
excellence
and
if
any
praise
these things
think on
What
also
you have learned
and
have received
and
have heard
and
have seen
in
me
these things
practice
and
the
God
-
of peace
will be
with
you
I rejoiced
however
in
[the] Lord
greatly
that
now
at last
you revived
the
for
me
caring
wherein
which
also
you were concerned
you were lacking opportunity
however
Not
that
as to
destitution
I speak
I
for
have learned
in
that which
I am
content
to be
I know
also
[how] to be brought low
I know
also
[how] to abound
In
everything
and
in
all things
I have learned the secret
also
to be full
and
to hunger
also
to abound
and
to be deficient
[For] all things
I have strength
in
the [One]
strengthening
me
But
well
you did
having fellowship in
my
-
affliction
Know
now
also
you
Philippians
that
in
[the] beginning
of the
gospel
when
I went out
from
Macedonia
not one
with me
church
had partnership
with regard to
the matter
of giving
and
receiving
if
not
you
alone
For
even
in
Thessalonica
both
once
and
twice
for
the
needs
of me
you sent
Not
that
I seek after
the
gift
but
I seek after
the
fruit
-
abounding
to
[the] account
of you
I have
however
all things
and
abound
I am full
having received
from
Epaphroditus
the things
from
you
an odor
of a sweet smell
a sacrifice
acceptable
well-pleasing
-
to God
-
And
[the] God
of me
will fill up
all
[the] needs
of you
according to
the
riches
of Him
in
glory
in
Christ
Jesus
To
now
[the] God
and
Father
of us [is]
[be] the
glory
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
Greet
every
saint
in
Christ
Jesus
Greet
you
the
with
me
brothers
Greet
you
all
the
saints
especially
now
those
from

Caesar's
household
The
grace
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
[be] with
the
spirit
of you
Paul
an apostle
of Christ
Jesus
by
[the] will
of God
and
Timothy
the
brother
To the
in
Colossae
saints
and
faithful
brothers
in
Christ
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
[the] Father
of us
We give thanks
to the
God
[and] Father
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
continually
for
you
praying
having heard of
the
faith
of you
in
Christ
Jesus
and
the
love
that
you have
toward
all
the
saints
because of
the
hope
-
being laid up
for you
in
the
heavens
which
you heard of before
in
the
word
of
truth
the
gospel
the [one]
being present
unto
you
just as
also
in
all
the
world
it is
bearing fruit
and
increasing
just as
also
among
you
from
the
day
you heard
and
knew
the
grace
-
of God
in
truth
just as
you learned
from
Epaphras
the
beloved
fellow bond-servant
of us
who
is
faithful
on behalf of
us
a servant
-
of Christ
the [one]
also
having made known
to us
-
your
love
in
[the] Spirit
Because of
this
also
we
from
the
day
we heard
not
cease
for
you
praying
and
asking
that
you may be filled with
the
knowledge
of the
will
of Him
in
all
wisdom
and
understanding
spiritual
to walk
worthily
of the
Lord
in
all
pleasing
in
every
work
good
bringing forth fruit
and
growing
in the
knowledge
-
of God
with
all
power
being strengthened
according to
the
might
-
glorious
of Him
unto
all
endurance
and
patience
with
joy
giving thanks
to the
Father
the [One]
having qualified
you
for
the
share
of the
inheritance
of the
saints
in
the
light
who
has delivered
us
from
the
dominion
-
of darkness
and
transferred [us]
into
the
kingdom
of the
Son
-
beloved
of Him
in
whom
we have
-
redemption
the
forgiveness
-
of sins
[He]
is
[the] image
of the
God
-
invisible
[the] firstborn
over all
creation
because
in
Him
were created
-
all things
in
the
heavens
and
upon
the
earth
the
visible
and
the
invisible
whether
thrones
or
dominions
or
rulers
or
authorities
-
all things
through
Him
and
unto
Him
have been created
And
He
is
before
all things
and
-
all things
in
Him
hold together
And
He
is
the
head
of the
body
the
church
who
is
beginning
firstborn
out from
the
dead
so that
might be
in
all things
He
holding preeminence
because
in
Him
was pleased
all
the
fullness
to dwell
and
by
Him
to reconcile
-
all things
to
Himself
having made peace
by
the
blood
of the
cross
of Him
through
Him
whether
the things
on
the
earth
or
the things
in
the
heavens
And
you
once
being
alienated
and
hostile
-
in mind
in
the
deeds
-
evil
now
however
He has reconciled [You]
in
the
body
of the
flesh
of Him
through
-
death
to present
you
holy
and
unblemished
and
blameless
before
Him
if
indeed
you continue
-
in the faith
established
and
firm
and
not
being moved away
from
the
hope
of the
gospel
that
you have heard
-
having been proclaimed
in
all
creation
-
under
-
heaven
of which
have become
I
Paul
a minister
Now
I rejoice
in
the
sufferings
for
you
and
I am filling up
that which
is lacking
of the
tribulations
-
of Christ
in
the
flesh
of me
for
the
body
of Him
which
is
the
church
of which
became
I
a minister
according to
the
administration
-
of God
-
having been given
me
toward
you
to complete
the
word
-
of God
the
mystery
-
having been hidden
from
the
ages
and
from
the
generations
now
however
having been manifested
to the
saints
of Him
to whom
has willed
-
God
to make known
what [is]
the
riches
of the
glory
of the
mystery
this
among
the
Gentiles
which
is
Christ
in
you
the
hope
-
of glory
whom
we
preach
admonishing
every
man
and
teaching
every
man
in
all
wisdom
so that
we may present
every
man
perfect
in
Christ
Unto
this
also
I toil
striving
according to
the
energy
of Him
-
working
in
me
in
power
I want
for
you
to know
how great
a struggle
I am having
for
you
and
those
in
Laodicea
and
as many as
not
have seen
the
face
of me
in
[the] flesh
that
may be encouraged
the
hearts
of them
having been knit together
in
love
and
to
all
[the] riches
of the
full assurance
-
of understanding
to
[the] knowledge
of the
mystery
-
of God
[which is] Christ
in
whom
are
all
the
treasures
-
of wisdom
and
of knowledge
hidden
This
I say
so that
no one
you
might delude
by
persuasive speech
If
truly
indeed
in the
flesh
I am absent
yet
-
in spirit
with
you
I am
rejoicing
and
seeing
your
-
good order
and
the
firmness
of the
in
Christ
faith
of you
Just as
therefore
you have received
-
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
in
Him
walk
having been rooted
and
being built up
in
Him
and
being strengthened in
the
faith
just as
you were taught
abounding
with
thanksgiving
Take heed
lest
anyone
you
there will be
-
taking captive
through
-
philosophy
and
empty
deceit
according to
the
tradition
-
of men
according to
the
principles
of the
world
and
not
according to
Christ
For
in
Him
dwells
all
the
fullness
of the
Deity
bodily
and
you are
in
Him
complete
who
is
the
head
of all
rule
and
authority
in
whom
also
you were circumcised
with [the] circumcision
made without hands
in
the
removal
of the
body
of the
flesh
in
the
circumcision
-
of Christ
having been buried with
Him
in
-
baptism
in
which
also
you were raised with [Him]
through
the
faith
of the
working
-
of God
the [One]
having raised
Him
out from
the dead
And
you
dead
being
the
trespasses
and
in the
uncircumcision
of the
flesh
of you
He made alive together
you
with
Him
having forgiven
us
all
the
transgressions
having blotted out
the
against
us
handwriting
in the
decrees
which
was
adverse
to us
and
it
He has taken
out of
the
way
having nailed
it
to the
cross
Having disarmed
the
rulers
and
the
authorities
He made a show [of them]
in
public
having triumphed
over them
in
it
Not
therefore
anyone
you
let judge
in regard to
food
or
in regard to
drink
or
in
regard
to a feast
or
a New Moon
or
Sabbaths
which
are
a shadow
the things
coming
the
however
body [is]
-
of Christ
No one
you
let disqualify
delighting
in
humility
and
[the] worship
of the
angels
which
he has seen
detailing
vainly
being puffed up
by
the
mind
of the
flesh
of him
and
not
holding fast
to the
head
from
whom
all
the
body
by
the
joints
and
ligaments
being supplied
and
being knit together
increases
with the
increase
-
of God
If
you have died
with
Christ
away from
the
principles
of the
world
why
as if
living
in
[the] world
do you submit to decrees
Not
you should handle
Not
you should taste
Not
you should touch
which
are
all
unto
decay
with the
use
according to
the
commandments
and
teachings
-
of men
which
are
an appearance
indeed
having
of wisdom
in
self-imposed worship
and
humility
and
harsh treatment
of [the] body
not
of
honor
a certain
against
[the] indulgence
of the
flesh
If
then
you have been raised with
-
Christ
the things
above
seek
where
-
Christ
is
at [the]
right hand
-
of God
sitting
The things
above
set [your] minds on
not
the things
on
the
earth
You have died
for
and
the
life
of you
has been hidden
with
-
Christ
in
-
God
When
-
Christ
may be revealed
the
life
of you
then
also
you
with
Him
will appear
in
glory
Put to death
therefore
the
members
which [are]
upon
the
earth
sexual immorality
impurity
passion
desire
evil
and
-
covetousness
which
is
idolatry
because of
which things
is coming
the
wrath
-
of God
in
which
also
you
walked
once
when
you were living
in
them
Now
however
put off
also
you
-
all [these] things
anger
rage
malice
slander
foul language
out of
the
mouth
of you
Not
do lie
to
one another
having put off
the
old
man
with
the
practices
of him
and
having put on
the
new
the [one]
being renewed
in
knowledge
according to
[the] image
of the [one]
having created
him
where
not
there is
Greek
and
Jew
circumcision
and
uncircumcision
Barbarian
Scythian
slave
free
but
all
and
in
all
Christ [is]
Put on
therefore
as
[the] elect
-
of God
holy
and
beloved
hearts
of compassion
kindness
humility
gentleness
[and] patience
bearing with
each other
and
forgiving
each other
If
anyone
against
another
should have
a complaint
even as
also
the
Lord
has forgiven
you
so
also
you
Beyond
all
now
these
[put on] the
love
which
is
[the] bond
-
of perfect unity
And
the
peace
-
from Christ
let rule
in
the
hearts
of you
to
which
also
you were called
in
one
body
And
thankful
be
The
word
-
of Christ
let dwell
in
you
richly
in
all
wisdom
teaching
and
admonishing
each other
in psalms
hymns
[and] songs
spiritual
with
-
grace
singing
in
the
hearts
of you
to
God
And
everything
which
what
if
you might do
in
word
or
in
deed
all
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
Jesus
giving thanks
-
to God
[the] Father
through
Him
-
Wives
submit yourselves
to the
husbands
as
is fitting
in
[the] Lord
-
Husbands
love
the
wives
and
not
be harsh
toward
them
-
Children
obey
the
parents
in
all things
this
for
pleasing
is
in
[the] Lord
-
Fathers
not
do provoke
the
children
of you
that
not
they might become discouraged
-
Slaves
obey
in
all things
the
according to
flesh
masters
not
with
eye-services
as
men-pleasers
but
in
sincerity
of heart
fearing
the
Lord
Whatever
if
you might do
from
[the] soul
work
as
to the
Lord
and
not
to men
knowing
that
from
[the] Lord
you will receive
the
reward
of the
inheritance
The
Lord
Christ
you serve
The [one]
for
doing wrong
will be repaid [for]
what
he has done wrong
and
not
there is
partiality
-
Masters
that which
[is] righteous
and
that which
[is] equal
to the
slaves
give
knowing
that
also
you
have
a Master
in
heaven
-
In prayer
continue steadfastly
watching
in
it
with
thanksgiving
praying
at the same time
also
for
us
that
-
God
may open
to us
a door
for the
word
to declare
the
mystery
-
of Christ
on account of
which
also
I have been bound
so that
I should make clear
it
as
it behooves
me
to speak
In
wisdom
walk
toward
those
outside
the
time
redeeming
-
[Let the] speech
of you
[be] always
in
grace
with salt
having been seasoned
to know
how
it behooves
you
one
each
to answer
The things
concerning
me
all
will make known
to you

beloved
brother

purpose
that
you might know
the things
concerning
us
and
he may encourage
the
hearts
of you
with

you

labor
-
of love
and
the
endurance
of the
hope
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
before
the
God
and
Father
of us
knowing
brothers
beloved
by
-
God
the
election
of you
because
the
gospel
of us
not
came
to
you
in
word
only
but
also
in
power
and
in
[the] Spirit
Holy
and
full assurance
much
just as
you know
what
we were
among
you
on account of
you
And
you
imitators
of us
became
and
of the
Lord
having received
the
word
in
tribulation
much
with
[the] joy
of [the] Spirit
Holy
so as for
to became
you
an example
to all
the
believing [ones]
in
-
Macedonia
and
in
-
Achaia
From
you
for
has sounded forth
the
word
of the
Lord
not
only
in
-
Macedonia
and
Achaia
but
in
every
place
the
faith
of you
-
toward
-
God
has gone abroad
so as for
no
need
to have
us
to say
anything
They themselves
for
concerning
us
report
what
reception
we had
from
you
and
how
you turned
to
-
God
from
-
idols
to serve
[the] God
living
and
true
and
to await
the
Son
of Him
from
the
heavens
whom
He raised
out from
the
dead
Jesus
the [one]
delivering
us
from
the
wrath
-
coming
You yourselves
for
know
brothers
the
coming
of us
-
to
you
that
not
in vain
has been
but
having previously suffered
and
having been mistreated
just as
you know
in
Philippi
we had boldness
in
the
God
of us
to speak
to
you
the
gospel
-
of God
amid
much
conflict
-
For
the exhortation
of us
[is] not
of
error
nor
of
impurity
nor
in
trickery
but
just as
we have been approved
by
-
God
to be entrusted with
the
gospel
so
we speak
not
as
men
pleasing
but
God
the [One]
examining
the
hearts
of us
Never
for
at any time
with
word
of flattery
were we
just as
you know
nor
with
a pretext
for greed
God [is]
witness
nor
seeking
from
men
glory
nor
from
you
nor
from
others
[though] having authority
with
weight
to be
as
Christâs
apostles
But
we were
gentle
in
[the] midst
of you
as
if
a nursing mother
would cherish
-
her own
children
So
yearning over
you
we were pleased
to have imparted
to you
not
only
the
gospel
-
of God
but
also
our
own
lives
because
beloved
to us
you have become
You remember
for
brothers
the
labor
of us
and
-
hardship
Night
and
day
working
in order
-
not
to burden
anyone
of you
we proclaimed
to
you
the
gospel
-
of God
You [are]
witnesses
and
-
God
how
holily
and
righteously
and
blamelessly
toward you
those
believing
we were
just as
you know
how
one
each
of you
as
a father
children
his own
exhorting
you
and
comforting
and
charging
unto
-
to walk
you
worthily
-
of God
who
calls
you
into
the
of Himself
kingdom
and
glory
And
because of
this
also
we
give thanks
-
to God
unceasingly
that
having received
[the] word
[by your] hearing
from
us
-
of God
you accepted
not
[the] word
of men
but
even as
truly
it is
[the] word
of God
which
also
works
in
you
who
believe
You
for
imitators
became
brothers
of the
churches
-
of God
-
being
in
-
Judea
in
Christ
Jesus
For
the same
as them
suffered
also
you
from
the
own
countrymen
as
also [did]
they
from
the
Jews
who
both
the
Lord
having killed
Jesus
and
their own
prophets
and
us
having driven out
and
God
not
pleasing
and
all
men
[who are] set against
hindering
us
to the
Gentiles
to speak
that
they might be saved
so as
-
to fill up
their
-
sins
always
Has come
now
upon
them
the
wrath
to the
utmost
We
however
brothers
having been bereaved
of
you
for
[the] time
of an hour
in face
not
in heart
more abundantly
were eager
the
face
of you
to see
with
great
desire
Therefore
we wanted
to come
to
you
I
indeed
Paul
both
once
and
twice
and
hindered
us
-
Satan
Who [is]
for
our
hope
or
joy
or
crown
of boasting
Or
[are] not
even
you
before
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
at
-
His
coming
You
for
are
the
glory
of us
and
-
joy
Therefore
no longer
enduring
we thought it best
to be left behind
in
Athens
alone
and
we sent
Timothy
the
brother
of us
and
fellow worker
-
of God
in
the
gospel
-
of Christ
in order
-
to strengthen
you
and
to encourage
concerning
the
faith
of you
that
no one
be moved
in
the
tribulations
these
Yourselves
for
you know
that
for
this
we are destined
And
indeed
when
with
you
we were
we were telling beforehand
you
that
we are about
to suffer affliction
just as
also
it came to pass
and
you know
Because of
this
I also
no longer
enduring
sent
in order
-
to know
the
faith
of you
lest
somehow
had tempted
you
the [one]
tempting
and
in
vain
would be
the
labor
of us
Presently
however
having come
Timothy
to
us
from
you
and
having brought good news
to us
of the
faith
and
the
love
of you
and
that
you have
a remembrance
of us
good
always
longing
us
to see
just as
also
we
you
because of
this
we were encouraged
brothers
as to
you
in
all
the
distress
and
tribulation
of us
through
-
your
faith
For
now
we live
if
you
are standing firm
in
[the] Lord
What
for
thanksgiving
are we able
-
to God
to give
concerning
you
in return for
all
the
joy
that
we rejoice
because of
you
before
the
God
of us
night
and
day
exceedingly
imploring
for [us]
-
to see
your
-
face
and
to supply
the things
lacking
in the
faith
of you
Himself
now
the
God
and
Father
of us
and
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
may direct
the
way
of us
to
you
You
now
the
Lord
may make to increase
and
to abound
-
in love
toward
one another
and
toward
all
just as
also
we
toward
you
in order
-
to strengthen
your
-
hearts
blameless
in
holiness
before
the
God
and
Father
of us
at
the
coming
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
with
all
the
saints
of Him
Finally
then
brothers
we implore
you
and
exhort
in
[the] Lord
Jesus
that
just as
you have received
from
us
-
in what manner
it behooves
you
to walk
and
to please
God
just as
even
you walk [now]
so
you should abound
more
You know
for
what
instructions
we gave
you
through
the
Lord
Jesus
This
for
is
[the] will
-
of God
the
sanctification
of you
To abstain
you [are]
from
-
sexual immorality
to know
each
of you [how]
the
of himself
vessel
to control
in
holiness
and
honor
not
in
[the] passion
of lust
as
also
the
Gentiles
-
not
knowing
-
God
-
not
to go beyond
and
to overreach
in
the
matter
the
brother
of him
because
avenging [is]
[the] Lord
concerning
all
these things
just as
also
we told before
you
and
thoroughly warned
Not
for
has called
us
-
God
to
impurity
but
into
holiness
So then
the [one]
rejecting [this]
not
man
disregards
but
-
God
the [One]
also
giving
the
Spirit
of Him
-
Holy
to
you
Concerning
now
-
brotherly love
no
need
you have [for me]
to write
to you
yourselves
for
you
taught by God
are
in order
-
to love
one another
And
for
you are doing
this
toward
all
the
brothers
in
all
-
Macedonia
We exhort
however
you
brothers
to abound
more and more
and
to strive earnestly
to live quietly
and
to attend to
the
own
and
to work with
the
hands
of you
just as
you
we commanded
so that
you may walk
properly
toward
those
outside
and
of no one
need
may have
Not
we do want
but
you
to be ignorant
brothers
concerning
those
having fallen asleep
so that
not
you should be grieved
just as
also
the
rest
those
not
having
hope
If
for
we believe
that
Jesus
died
and
rose again
so
also
-
God
those
having fallen asleep
through
-
Jesus
will bring
with
Him
This
for
to you
we declare
in
[the] word
of [the] Lord
that
we
the
living
-
remaining
unto
the
coming
of the
Lord
no
not
shall precede
those
having fallen asleep
because
Himself
the
Lord
with
a loud command
with
the voice
of an archangel
and
with
[the] trumpet
of God
will descend
from
heaven
and
the
dead
in
Christ
will rise
first
Then
we
the
living
-
remaining
together
with
them
will be caught away
in
[the] clouds
for
[the] meeting
of the
Lord
in
[the] air
and
so
always
with
[the] Lord
we will be
Therefore
encourage
one another
with
the
words
these
Concerning
now
the
times
and
the
seasons
brothers
no
need
you have
to you
to be written
Yourselves
for
fully
you know
that
[the] day
of [the] Lord
as
a thief
by
night
in this manner
comes
For when
they might say
Peace
and
security
then
suddenly
upon them
comes
destruction
as
the
labor pains
to her
in
womb
having
and
no
not
shall they escape
You
however
brothers
not
are
in
darkness
that
the
day
you
like
a thief
should overtake
All
for
you
sons
of light
are
and
sons
of day
Not
we are
of night
nor
of darkness
So
then
not
we should sleep
as
the
others
but
we should watch
and
we should be sober
Those
for
sleeping
by night
sleep
and
those
becoming drunk
by night
get drunk
We
however
of [the] day
being
should be sober
having put on
[the] breastplate
of faith
and
love
and
[the] helmet
[the] hope
of salvation
because
not
has destined
us
-
God
for
wrath
but
for
obtaining
salvation
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the [One]
having died
for
us
so that
whether
we might watch
or
we might sleep
together
with
Him
we may live
Therefore
encourage
one another
and
build up
one
-
another
just as
also
you are doing
We implore
however
you
brothers
to appreciate
those
toiling
among
you
and
taking the lead
over you
in
[the] Lord
and
admonishing
you
and
to esteem
them
exceedingly
in
love
because of
the
work
of them
Be at peace
among
yourselves
We exhort
now
you
brothers
to admonish
the
unruly
encourage
the
fainthearted
help
the
weak
be patient
toward
all
See that
no
one
evil
for
evil
to anyone
has repaid
but
always
the
good
pursue
toward
one another
and
toward
all
Always
rejoice
Unceasingly
pray
In
everything
give thanks
this
for
[is the] will
of God
in
Christ
Jesus
toward
you
The
Spirit
not
do quench
Prophecies
not
do despise
All things
however
test
To the
good
hold fast
From
every
form
of evil
abstain
Himself
now
the
God
-
of peace
may sanctify
you
completely
and
entirely
your
-
spirit
and
-
soul
and
-
body
blameless
at
the
coming
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
may be preserved
[Is] faithful
the [One]
calling
you
who
also
will do [it]
Brothers
pray
for
us
Greet
the
brothers
all
with
a kiss
holy
I adjure
you
[by] the
Lord
to be read
[this]
letter
to all
the
brothers
The
grace
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
[be] with
you
Paul
and
Silvanus
and
Timothy
To the
church
of [the] Thessalonians
in
God
[the] Father
of us
and
the Lord
Jesus
Christ
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
[the] Father
and
the Lord
Jesus
Christ
To thank
we ought
-
God
always
concerning
you
brothers
just as
fitting
it is
because
is increasing exceedingly
the
faith
of you
and
is abounding
the
love
of one
each
of all
you
to
one another
so as for
ourselves
us
in
you
to boast
in
the
churches
-
of God
about
the
perseverance
of you
and
faith
in
all
the
persecutions
of you
and
in the
tribulations
that
you are bearing
[This is] a plain token
of the
righteous
judgment
-
of God
unto
-
to be accounted worthy
you
of the
kingdom
-
of God
for
which
also
you suffer
For indeed
righteous [it is]
with
God
to repay
those
oppressing
you
with affliction
and
to you
-
being oppressed
repose
with
us
at
the
revelation
of the
Lord
Jesus
from
heaven
with
[the] angels
mighty
of Him
in
a fire
of flame
inflicting
vengeance
on those
not
knowing
God
and
on those
not
obeying
the
gospel
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
who
[the] penalty
will suffer
of destruction
eternal
away from
[the] presence
of the
Lord
and
from
the
glory
of the
power
of Him
when
He shall come
to be glorified
in
the
saints
of Him
and
to be marveled at
among
all
those
having believed
because
was believed
the
testimony
of us
to
you
in
the
day
that
for
which
also
we pray
always
for
you
that
you
He may count worthy
of the
calling
of the
God
of us
and
He may fulfill
every
good pleasure
of goodness
and
work
of faith
with
power
so that
may be glorified
the
name
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
in
you
and
you
in
Him
according to
the
grace
of the
God
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
We implore
now
you
brothers
by
the
coming
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
our
gathering together
unto
Him
for
-
not
quickly
to be shaken
you
in
-
mind
nor
to be troubled
neither
by
spirit
nor
by
word
nor
by
letter
as if
by
us
as
that
is present
the
day
of the
Lord
No
one
you
should deceive
in
not one
way
because [it is]
if
not [until]
shall have come
the
apostasy
first
and
shall have been revealed
the
man
-
of lawlessness
the
son
-
of destruction
the [one]
opposing
and
exalting himself
above
every
so-called
god
or
object of worship
so as for
him
in
the
temple
-
of God
to sit down
setting forth
he himself
that
is
God
Not
do you remember
that
yet
being
with
you
these things
I was saying
to you
And
now
that which
is restraining
you know
for
-
to be revealed
him
in
-
his
time
The
for
mystery
already
is working
-
of lawlessness
only [there is]
the [one]
restraining [it]
at present
until
out of
[the] midst
he might be [gone]
And
then
will be revealed
the
lawless [one]
whom
the
Lord
Jesus
will slay
with the
breath
of the
mouth
of Him
and
will annul
by the
appearing
of the
coming
of Him
whose
is
-
coming
according to
[the] working
-
of Satan
in
every
power
and
in signs
and
in wonders
of falsehood
and
in
every
deceit
of wickedness
unto those
perishing
in return for
which
the
love
of the
truth
not
they received
in order for
-
to be saved
them
And
because of
this
will send
to them
-
God
a working
of delusion
for
-
to believe
them
what
[is] false
in order that
should be judged
all
those
not
having believed
the
truth
but
having delighted
-
in unrighteousness
We
however
ought
to give thanks
-
to God
always
concerning
you
brothers
beloved
by
[the] Lord
that
has chosen
you
-
God
from
[the] beginning
unto
salvation
in
[the] sanctification
of [the] Spirit
and
[by] faith
of [the] truth
to
this
also
He called
you
through
the
gospel
of us
to
[the] obtaining
of [the] glory
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
So
then
brothers
stand firm
and
hold fast
to the
traditions
that
you were taught
whether
by
word
or
by
letter
from us
Himself
now
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
-
God
the
Father
of us
the [One]
having loved
us
and
having given [us]
comfort
eternal
and
hope
good
by
grace
may He encourage
your
-
hearts
and
may He strengthen [them]
in
every
work
and
word
good
-
Finally
pray
brothers
for
us
that
the
word
of the
Lord
may spread quickly
and
may be glorified
just as
also
with
you
and
that
we may be delivered
from
-
perverse
and
evil
men
not
for
all [are]
of the
faith
Faithful
however
is
the
Lord
who
will strengthen
you
and
will keep [you]
from
-
evil
We are persuaded
now
in
[the] Lord
as to
you
that
the things that
we command
both
you are doing
and
you will do
-
And
the Lord
may direct
your
-
hearts
into
the
love
-
of God
and
into
the
steadfastness
-
of Christ
We command
now
you
brothers
in
[the] name
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
are to withdraw
you
from
every
brother
idly
walking
and
not
according to
the
tradition
that
you received
from
us
Yourselves
for
you know
how
it behooves [you]
to imitate
us
because
not
we were idle
among
you
nor
without payment
bread
did we eat
from
anyone
but
in
labor
and
hardship
night
and
day
working
in order
-
not
to be burdensome to
any
of you
not
that
not
we have
[the] right
but
that
ourselves
[as] an example
we may offer
to you
for
-
you to imitate
us
Even
for
when
we were
with
you
this
we were commanding
you
that
if
anyone
not
is willing
to work
neither
let him eat
We hear
for
some
are walking
among
you
idly
not at all
working
but
being busybodies
To
now
such
we warn
and
exhort
by
our Lord
Jesus
Christ
so that
with
quietness
working
-
their own
bread
they may eat
You
now
brothers
not
shall grow weary
[in] well-doing
If
then
anyone
not
obey
this
instruction
of us
through
the
letter
of this [man]
take note
not
to mix with
him
so that
he may be ashamed
And yet
not
as
an enemy
esteem [him]
but
admonish [him]
as
a brother
Himself
now
the
Lord
-
of peace
may give
you
-
peace
through
all
in
every
way
The
Lord [be]
with
all
of you
The
greeting
-
in my own
hand
Paul
which
is
[my] sign
in
every
letter
In this manner
I write
The
grace
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
[be] with
all
of you
Paul
an apostle
of Christ
Jesus
according to
[the] command
of God
[the] Savior
of us
and
of Christ
Jesus
the
hope
of us
To Timothy
[my] true
child
in
[the] faith
Grace
mercy
[and] peace
from
God
[the] Father
and
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
Just as
I urged
you
to remain
in
Ephesus
[when] I was going
to
Macedonia
so that
you might warn
certain men
not
to teach other doctrines
nor
to give heed
to myths
and
genealogies
endless
which
speculations
bring
rather
than
stewardship
of God
which [is]
in
faith
-
And
the goal
of [our]
instruction
is
love
out of
a pure
heart
and
a conscience
good
and
a faith
sincere
from which
some
having missed the mark
have turned aside
to
meaningless discourse
desiring
to be
teachers of the Law
not
understanding
neither
what
they are saying
nor
[that] about
which
they confidently assert
We know
now
that
good [is]
the
law
if
one
it
lawfully
uses
knowing
this
that
for a righteous [one]
law
not
is enacted
for [the] lawless
however
and
insubordinate
for [the] ungodly
and
sinful
for [the] unholy
and
profane
for murderers of fathers
and
murderers of mothers
for slayers of man
for the sexually immoral
homosexuals
enslavers
liars
perjurers
and
if
anything
other
in the
being sound
teaching
is opposed to
according to
the
gospel
of the
glory
of the
blessed
God
with which
have been entrusted
I
Thankfulness
I have
for the [One]
having strengthened
me
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
that
faithful
me
He esteemed
having appointed [me]
to
service
-
formerly
being
a blasphemer
and
a persecutor
and
insolent
but
I was shown mercy
because
being ignorant
I did [it]
in
unbelief
Surpassingly increased
then
the
grace
of the
Lord
of us
with
[the] faith
and
love
that [are]
in
Christ
Jesus
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
and
of full
acceptance
worthy
that
Christ
Jesus
came
into
the
world
sinners
to save
of whom
[the] foremost
am
I
But
because of
this
I was shown mercy
that
in
me
[the] foremost
might display
Jesus
Christ
-
perfect
patience
as
a pattern
for those
being about
to believe
on
Him
to
life
eternal
To
now
[the] King
of the
ages
[the] immortal
invisible
only
God
[be] honor
and
glory
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
This
-
charge
I commit
to you
[my] child
Timothy
according to
the
going before
as to
you
prophecies
that
you might war
by
them
the
good
warfare
holding
faith
and
a good
conscience
which
some
having cast away
concerning
the
faith
have caused a shipwreck
among whom
are
Hymenaeus
and
Alexander
whom
I have handed over
-
to Satan
that
they may be disciplined
not
to blaspheme
I exhort
therefore
first
of all
to be made
entreaties
prayers
intercessions
[and] thanksgivings
on behalf of
all
men
for
kings
and
all
those
in
authority
being
so that
a tranquil
and
quiet
life
we may lead
in
all
godliness
and
dignity
This
[is] good
and
acceptable
before
the
Savior
of us
God
who
all
men
desires
to be saved
and
to
[the] knowledge
of [the] truth
to come
One
for
God [there is]
one
then
mediator
between God
and
men
[the] man
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
having given
Himself
[as] a ransom
for
all
the
testimony
in proper times
their own
in regard to
which
was appointed
I
a herald
and
an apostle
[the] truth
I am speaking
not
I do lie
a teacher
of [the] Gentiles
in
faith
and
truth
I desire
therefore
to pray
the
men
in
every
place
lifting up
holy
hands
apart from
anger
and
dissension
Likewise
women
in
apparel
respectable
with
modesty
and
self-control
should adorn
themselves
not
with
braided hair
or
gold
or
pearls
or
clothing
costly
but
with what
is becoming
to women
professing
[the] fear of God
through
works
good
A woman
in
quietness
let learn
in
all
submissiveness
To teach
however
a woman
not
I do permit
nor
to use authority over
a man
but
to be
in
quietness
Adam
for
first
was formed
then
Eve
And
Adam
not
was deceived
-
but
the woman
having been deceived
into
transgression
has come
She will be saved
however
through
-
childbearing
if
they abide
in
faith
and
love
and
holiness
with
self-restraint
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
If
anyone
overseership
aspires to
of good
a work
he is desirous
It behooves
therefore
the
overseer
above reproach
to be
of one
wife
[the] husband
sober
self-controlled
respectable
hospitable
able to teach
not
given to wine
not
a striker
but
gentle
peaceable
not loving money
the
own
house
well
managing
children
having
in
submission
with
all
dignity
if
but
one
the
own
household
to manage
not
knows
how
[the] church
of God
[how] will he care for
not
a novice
that
not
having been puffed up
into
[the] judgment
he might fall
of the
devil
It behooves [him]
now
also
a testimony
good
to have
from
those
outside
so that
not
into
reproach
he might fall
and
[the] snare
of the
devil
Deacons
likewise
[must be] dignified
not
double-tongued
not
to wine
much
being given
not
greedy of dishonest gain
holding
to the
mystery
of the
faith
with
clear
a conscience
Also
these
now
let them be tested
first
then
let them serve
blameless
being
Women
likewise
[must be] dignified
not
slanderers
clear-minded
faithful
in
all things
Deacons
let be
of one
wife
husbands
[their] children
well
managing
and
the
own
households
Those
for
well
having served
a standing
for themselves
good
acquire
and
great
confidence
in
[the] faith
that [is]
in
Christ
Jesus
These things
to you
I am writing
hoping
to come
to
you
a short time
if
however
I should delay
so that
you may know
how
it behooves [one]
in
[the] household
of God
to conduct oneself
which
is
[the] church
of God
[the] living
[the] pillar
and
base
of the
truth
And
confessedly
great
is
the
-
of godliness
mystery
Who
was revealed
in
[the] flesh
was justified
in
[the] Spirit
was seen
by angels
was proclaimed
among
[the] nations
was believed on
in
[the] world
was taken up
in
glory
-
But
the Spirit
expressly
states
that
in
later
times
will depart from
some
the
faith
giving heed
to spirits
deceitful
and
teachings
of demons
in
hypocrisy
of speakers of lies
having been seared
in the
own
conscience
forbidding
to marry
[commanding] to abstain
from foods
that
-
God
created
for
reception
with
thanksgiving
by the
faithful
and
[those] knowing
the
truth
For
every
creature
of God
[is] good
and
nothing [is]
to be rejected
with
thanksgiving
being received
it is sanctified
for
by
[the] word
of God
and
prayer
These things
laying before
the
brothers
good
you will be
a servant
of Christ
Jesus
being nourished
in the
words
of the
faith
and
of the
good
teaching
that
you have closely followed
-
But
profane
and
silly
fables
refuse
Train
rather
yourself
to
godliness
-
For
bodily
exercise
of
a little
is
profit
-
but
godliness
for
everything
profitable
is
[the] promise
holding
of life
of the
present
and
of the [one]
coming
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
and
of full
acceptance
worthy
For
this
for
we toil
and
strive
because
we have hope
on
God
[the] living
who
is
[the] Savior
of all
men
especially
of believers
Command
these things
and
teach
No one
your
-
youth
let despise
but
a pattern
be
for the
believers
in
speech
in
conduct
in
love
in
faith
in
purity
Until
I come
give heed
to the
public reading of Scripture
to
exhortation
to
teaching
Not
be negligent
of the
in

gift
which
was given
to you
through
prophecy
with
[the] laying on
of the
hands
of the
elderhood
These things
ponder
in
them
be absorbed
so that
your
-
progress
evident
may be
to all
Give heed
to yourself
and
to the
teaching
Continue
in them
this
for
doing
both
yourself
you will save
and
those
hearing
you
An elder
not
do rebuke
but
exhort [him]
as
a father
younger [men]
as
brothers
elder [women]
as
mothers
[and] younger [women]
as
sisters
in
all
purity
Widows
honor
who [are]
truly
widows
If
however
any
widow
children
or
grandchildren
has
let them learn
first
to the
own
household
to be devout
and
recompense
to give
to
parents
this
for
is
pleasing
before
-
God
She who [is]
now
indeed
a widow
and
being left alone
has hope
in
God
and
continues
-
in supplications
and
-
prayers
night
and
day
She
however
living in self-indulgence
[while] living
is dead
Also
these things
command
so that
above reproach
they should be
If
now
anyone
the
own
and
especially [his]
household
not
does provide for
the
faith
he has denied
and
he is
than an unbeliever
worse
A widow
let be enrolled
not
less than
years [old]
sixty
being
of one
man
[the] wife
in
works
good
being borne witness to
if
she has brought up children
if
she entertained strangers
if
saintsâ
feet
she has washed
if [to those]
being oppressed
she has imparted relief
if
every
work
good
she has followed after
Younger
however
widows
refuse
when
for
they might grow wanton against
-
Christ
to marry
they desire
incurring
judgment
because
the
first
faith
they have cast off
At the same time
then
also
[to be] idle
they learn
going about
-
house to house
not
only
then
idle
but
also
gossips
and
busybodies
speaking
things
not
being proper
I want
therefore
[the] younger [ones]
to marry
to bear children
to manage their households
no
occasion
to give
the [one]
opposing
of reproach
on account
Already
for
some
have turned aside
after
-
Satan
If
any
believing [woman]
has
[dependent] widows
let her impart relief
to them
and
not
let be burdened
the
church
so that
to those [who are]
truly
widows
it may impart relief
The
well
ruling
elders
of double
honor
let be counted worthy
especially
those
straining
in
[the] word
and
[the] teaching
Says
for
the
Scripture
An ox
treading out grain
not
you shall muzzle
and
Worthy [is]
the
workman
of the
wages
of him
Against
an elder
an accusation
not
do receive
except
if
not
upon
two
or
three
witnesses
Those
sinning
before
all
rebuke
so that
also
the
rest
fear
might have
I earnestly testify
before
-
God
and
Christ
Jesus
and
the
elect
angels
that
these things
you should keep
apart from
prejudice
nothing
doing
out of
partiality
Hands
hastily
on no one
lay
nor
share
in [the] sins
of others
yourself
pure
keep
No longer
drink [only] water
but
wine
a little
use
because of
the
stomach
and
the
frequent
of you
ailments
Of some
men
the
sins
manifest
are
going before [them]
to
judgment
of some
however
also
they appear later
Likewise
also
the
works
-
good
[are] evident
and even
those
otherwise
being
to be concealed
not
able
As many as
are
under
a yoke
[as] slaves
the
own
masters
of all
honor
worthy
let them esteem
so that
not
the
name
-
of God
and
the
teaching
should be blasphemed
Those
now
believing
having
masters
not
let them despise [them]
because
brothers
they are
but
rather
let them serve [them]
because
believing [ones]
they are
and
beloved
-
by the
good service
being helped
These things
teach
and
exhort
If
anyone
teaches another doctrine
and
not
draws near
[the] being sound
words
-
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
and
the
according to
godliness
teaching
he is puffed up
nothing
knowing
but
unhealthy
about
controversies
and
disputes about words
out of
which
come
envy
strife
slander
suspicions
evil
[and] constant frictions
corrupted
among men
-
in mind
and
destitute
of the
truth
holding
a means of gain
to be
-
godliness
Is
however
gain
great
-
godliness
with
contentment
Nothing
for
we brought
into
the
world
because
neither
to carry out
anything
are we able
Having
however
sustenance
and
coverings
with these
we will be content
Those
however
desiring
to be rich
fall
into
temptation
and
a snare
and
desires
many
foolish
and
harmful
which
plunge
-
men
into
ruin
and
destruction
A root
for
of all kinds
-
of evils
is
the
love of money
which
some
stretching after
have been seduced
away from
the
faith
and
themselves
have pierced
with sorrows
many
You
however
O
man
of God
these things
flee
pursue
now
righteousness
godliness
faith
love
endurance
[and] gentleness
Fight
the
good
fight
of the
faith
Lay hold
of the
eternal
life
to
which
you were called
and also
did confess
the
good
confession
before
many
witnesses
I charge
before
-
God
the [One]
giving life
to
all things
and
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
having testified
before
Pontius
Pilate
the
good
confession
to keep
you
the
commandment
without stain
above reproach
until
the
appearing
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
which
seasons
in the own
He will display
the
blessed
and
alone
Sovereign
the
King
of those
being kings
and
[the] Lord
of those
being lords
-
alone
having
immortality
in light
dwelling
unapproachable
whom
has seen
no one
of men
nor
to see
is able
to whom [be]
honor
and
dominion
eternal
Amen
To the
rich
in
the
present
age
instruct [them]
not
to be high-minded
nor
to have hope
in
of riches
[the] uncertainty
but
on
God
the [One]
providing
us
all things
richly
for
enjoyment
to do good
to be rich
in
works
good
generous in distributing
to be
ready to share
treasuring up
for themselves
a foundation
good
for
the
future
so that
they may take hold
of
that which is indeed
life
O
Timothy
the
deposit committed [to you]
guard
avoiding
-
profane
empty babblings
and
opposing arguments
-
falsely called
knowledge
which
some
professing
from
the
faith
have gone astray
-
Grace [be]
with
you all
Paul
an apostle
of Christ
Jesus
by
[the] will
of God
according to
[the] promise
of life
-
in
Christ
Jesus
To Timothy
[my] beloved
child
Grace
mercy
[and] peace
from
God
[the] Father
and
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
Thankful
I am
-
to God
whom
I serve
from
[my] forefathers
with
a pure
conscience
as
unceasingly
I have
the
of
you
remembrance
in
the
prayers
of me
night
and
day
longing
you
to see
recalling
your
-
tears
so that
with joy
I may be filled
remembrance
having taken
of the
within
you
sincere
faith
which
dwelt
first
in
the
grandmother
of you
Lois
and
in the
mother
of you
Eunice
I am persuaded
now
that
also
[it is] in
you
For
this
reason
I remind
you
to kindle anew
the
gift
-
of God
which
is
in
you
by
the
laying on
of the
hands
of me
Not
for
has given
us
-
God
a spirit
of cowardice
but
of power
and
of love
and
of self-control
Not
therefore
you should be ashamed of
the
testimony
of the
Lord
of us
nor
of me
the
prisoner
of Him
but
suffer together
for the
gospel
according to
[the] power
of God
the [One]
having saved
us
and
having called [us]
with a calling
holy
not
according to
the
works
of us
but
according to
His own
purpose
and
grace
-
having been given
us
in
Christ
Jesus
before
time
eternal
having been made manifest
also
now
by
the
appearing
of the
Savior
of us
Christ
Jesus
having abolished
indeed
-
death
having brought to light
now
life
and
immortality
through
the
gospel
to
which
was appointed
I
a herald
and
an apostle
and
a teacher
For
this
reason
also
these things
I suffer
But
not
I am ashamed
I know
for
whom
I have believed
and
I am persuaded
that
able
He is
the
deposit entrusted
of me
to guard
for
that
-
day
[The] pattern
retain
of sound
words
which
from
me
you did hear
in
[the] faith
and
love
that [are]
in
Christ
Jesus
The
good
deposit entrusted [to you]
keep
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
the [One]
dwelling
in
us
You know
this
that
turned away from
me
all
those
in
-
Asia
among whom
are
Phygelus
and
Hermogenes
May grant
mercy
the
Lord
to the
of Onesiphorus
household
because
often
me
he refreshed
and
the
chain
of me
not
he was ashamed of
But
having arrived
in
Rome
earnestly
he sought out
me
and
found [me]
May grant
unto him
the
Lord
to find
mercy
from
[the] Lord
in
that
-
day
And
how much
in
Ephesus
he served
very well
you
know
You
therefore
child
of me
be strong
in
the
grace
that [is]
in
Christ
Jesus
And
the things which
you have heard
from
me
among
many
witnesses
these
entrust
to faithful
men
such as
sufficient
will be
also
others
to teach
Share in suffering
as
[a] good
soldier
of Christ
Jesus
No one
serving as a soldier
entangles himself
in the
of this
life
affairs
that
the [one]
having enlisted him
he might please
If
now
also
competes
anyone
not
he is crowned
if
not
lawfully
he shall have competed
For the
hardworking
farmer
it is necessary
first
of the
fruits
to partake
Consider
the things
I am saying
will give
for
you
the
Lord
understanding
in
all things
Remember
Jesus
Christ
having been raised
out from
[the] dead
of [the]
seed
of David
according to
-
gospel
my
in
which
I suffer hardship
even to
chains
as
an evildoer
But
the
word
-
of God
not
is bound
Because of
this
all things
I endure
for the sake of
the
elect
so that
also
they
[the] salvation
may obtain
that [is]
in
Christ
Jesus
with
glory
eternal
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
If
for
we have died together [with Him]
also
we will live together [with Him]
if
we endure
also
we will reign together [with Him]
if
we will deny [Him]
He also
will deny
us
if
we are faithless
He
faithful
remains
to deny
for
Himself
not
He is able
These things
remind [them]
solemnly charging [them]
before
-
God
not
to quarrel about words
for
nothing
profitable
[but] to
[the] subversion
of those
hearing
Hasten
yourself
approved
to present
-
to God
a workman
not ashamed
accurately handling
the
word
-
of truth
-
But
worldly
empty babblings
avoid
on
to more
for
they will lead
ungodliness
and
the
talk
of them
like
gangrene
pasture to grow
will have
among whom
are
Hymenaeus
and
Philetus
who
concerning
the
truth
have gone astray
asserting
resurrection
already
to have taken place
and
they are overthrowing
the
of some
faith
-
Nevertheless
the firm
foundation
of
God
stands
having
the
seal
this
Knows
[the] Lord
those
being
His
and
Let depart
from
iniquity
everyone
-
naming
the
name
of the Lord
In
a great
now
house
not
there are
only
vessels
golden
and
silver
but
also
wooden
and
earthen
and
some
indeed
unto
honor
some
however
unto
dishonor
If
therefore
anyone
shall have cleansed
himself
from
these
he will be
a vessel
for
honor
having been sanctified
useful
to the
Master
for
every
work
good
having been prepared
-
And
youthful
lusts
flee
pursue
now
righteousness
faith
love
[and] peace
along with
those
calling on
the
Lord
out of
pure
a heart
-
And
foolish
and
ignorant
speculations
refuse
knowing
that
they breed
quarrels
[The] bond-servant
now
of [the] Lord
not
it behooves
to quarrel
but
gentle
to be
toward
all
able to teach
forbearing
in
gentleness
disciplining
those
opposing
lest
ever
may give
them
-
God
repentance
unto
a knowledge
of [the] truth
and
they might come to their senses
out of
the
of the
devil
snare
having been captured
by
him
for
-
his
will
This
however
realize
that
in
[the] last
days
will be present
times
difficult
Will be
for
-
men
lovers of self
lovers of money
boastful
proud
abusive
to parents
disobedient
ungrateful
unholy
unloving
implacable
slanderous
without self-control
savage
without love of good
treacherous
reckless
puffed up
lovers of pleasure
rather
than
lovers of God
having
a form
of godliness
-
but
the power
of it
denying
And
these
turn away from
Out of
this sort
for
are
those
entering
into
-
households
and
taking captive
weak women
burdened
with sins
being led away
by passions
various
always
learning
and
never
to
a knowledge
of [the] truth
to come
being able
By which
way
now
Jannes
and
Jambres
opposed
Moses
so
also
these
oppose
the
truth
men
being depraved
-
in mind
disqualified
regarding
the
faith
But
not
they will advance
further
much
-
for
the folly
of them
plain
will be
to all
as
also
that
of those [two]
became
You
however
have closely followed
my
-
teaching
-
conduct
-
purpose
-
faith
-
patience
-
love
-
endurance
-
persecutions
-
sufferings
such as
to me
happened
in
Antioch
in
Iconium
in
Lystra
what manner of
persecutions
I endured
And yet
out of
all
me
delivered
the
Lord
Also
all
now
-
desiring
to live
piously
in
Christ
Jesus
will be persecuted
Evil
however
men
and
impostors
will advance
to
-
worse
deceiving
and
being deceived
You
however
abide
in
the things
you have learned
and
have been assured of
having known
from
whom
you learned [them]
and
that
from
childhood
sacred
writings
you have known
-
being able
you
to make wise
unto
salvation
through
faith
-
in
Christ
Jesus
Every
Scripture [is]
God-breathed
and
profitable
for
instruction
for
conviction
for
correction
[and] for
training
-
in
righteousness
so that
complete
may be
the
-
of God
man
toward
every
work
good
having been fully equipped
I earnestly declare
before
-
God
and
Christ
Jesus
the [One]
being about
to judge
[the] living
and
[the] dead
and
by the
appearing
of Him
and
the
kingdom
of Him
Preach
the
word
be ready
in season
[and] out of season
convict
rebuke
[and] exhort
with
complete
patience
and
instruction
There will be
for
a time
when
-
sound
teaching
not
they will endure
but
according to
the
own
desires
to themselves
they will gather around [them]
teachers
having an itching
-
ear
and
from
indeed
the
truth
-
hearing
they will turn away
unto
then
-
myths
they will be turned aside
You
however
be sober
in
all things
endure afflictions
[the] work
do
of an evangelist
the
ministry
of you
fully carry out
I
for
already
am being poured out
and
the
time
of the
departure
of me
is come
The
good
fight
I have fought
the
race
I have finished
the
faith
I have kept
From now on
is laid up
for me
the
-
of righteousness
crown
which
will award
to me
the
Lord
in
that
-
day
the
righteous
judge
not
only
however
to me
but
also
to all
those
loving
the
appearing
of Him
Be diligent
to come
to
me
quickly

exceedingly

he has opposed

our
message
In

of me
defense
no one
me
has stood with

all
me
deserted
Not
to them
may it be charged

And
the Lord
me
stood by
and
strengthened
me
so that
through
me
the
proclamation
would be fully accomplished
and
should hear
all
the
Gentiles
And
I was delivered
out of
[the] mouth
of the lion
Will deliver
me

from

Of this
on account
I left
you
in
Crete
so that
the things
lacking
you might set in order
and
might appoint
in every
town
elders
as
I
you
directed
if
anyone
is

of one

of debauchery
or

for

he may be

to encourage
with

-
sound
and
those
contradicting [it]
to convict
There are
for
many
insubordinate
empty talkers
and
deceivers
especially
those
of
the
circumcision
whom
it is necessary
to silence
who
whole
households
overthrow

for [the] sake of
Said
one
of

own
of them
a prophet
Cretans
[are] always
liars
evil
beasts
gluttons
lazy
The
testimony
this
is
true
for
which
cause
rebuke
them
severely
so that
they may be sound
in
the
faith
not
giving heed
to Jewish
myths

[the] commandments
of men
turning away from

All things [are]

they profess
to know

they deny [Him]
detestable

however
speak
the things that
are consistent with

are to be

In
all things
yourself
be holding forth
[as] a pattern
of good
works
in
the
teaching
integrity
dignity
speech
sound
beyond reproach
so that
he who is
of the
contrary
may be ashamed
nothing
having
to say
concerning
us
evil
Servants
to their own
masters
are to be subject
in
everything
well-pleasing
to be
not
gainsaying
not
pilfering
but
all
fidelity
showing
good
so that
the
doctrine
of
the
Savior
of us
God
they may adorn
in
all things
Has appeared
for
the
grace
-
of God
bringing salvation
to all
men
instructing
us
that
having denied
-
ungodliness
and
-
worldly
passions
discreetly
and
righteously
and
piously
we should live
in
the
present
age
awaiting
the
blessed
hope
and
[the] appearing
of the
glory
of the
great
God
and
Savior
of us
Christ
Jesus
who
gave
Himself
for
us
that
He might redeem
us
from
all
lawlessness
and
might purify
to Himself
a people
specially chosen
zealous
of good
works
These things
speak
and
exhort
and
rebuke
with
all
authority
No one
you
let despise
Remind
them
to rulers
to authorities
to be subject
to be obedient
for
every
work
good
ready
to be
no one
to speak evil of
peaceable
to be
gentle
all
showing
humility
toward
all
men
Were
for
once
also
we ourselves
foolish
disobedient
being deceived
serving
lusts
and
pleasures
various
in
malice
and
envy
living
hateful
hating
one another
When
however
the
kindness
and
the
love of mankind
appeared
of the
Savior
of us
God
not
by
works
-
in
righteousness
that
did
we
but
according to
-
His
mercy
He saved
us
through
[the] washing
of regeneration
and
renewing
of [the] Spirit
Holy
whom
He poured out
on
us
richly
through
Jesus
Christ
the
Savior
of us
so that
having been justified
-
by that
grace
heirs
we should become
according to
[the] hope
of life
eternal
Trustworthy [is]
the
saying
and
concerning
these things
I want
you
to affirm strongly
so that
may take care
good
works
to be devoted to
those
believing
God
These things
are
excellent
and
profitable
-
to men
Foolish
however
controversies
and
genealogies
and
arguments
and
quarrels
about [the] Law
avoid
they are
for
unprofitable
and
worthless
A factious
man
after
one
and
a second
admonition
reject
knowing
that
is corrupt
-
such a man
and
is sinning
being
self-condemned
When
I shall send
Artemas
to
you
or
Tychicus
be diligent
to come
to
me
into
Nicopolis
there
for
I have decided
to winter
Zenas
the
lawyer
and
Apollos
earnestly
equip
so that
nothing
to them
should be lacking
Let learn
now
also
-
our [people]
good
works
to devote themselves to
for
-
necessary
needs
so that
not
they should be
unfruitful
Greet
you
those
with
me
all
Greet
those
loving
us
in
[the] faith
-
Grace [be]
with
all
of you
Paul
a prisoner
of Christ
Jesus
and
Timothy
[our]
brother
To Philemon
the
beloved
and
fellow worker
of us
and
to Apphia
our
sister
and
to Archippus
the
fellow soldier
of us
and
to the
at
[the] house
of you
church
Grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
Father
of us
and
[the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
I thank
the
God
of me
always
mention
of you
making
upon
the
prayers
of me
hearing
of your
-
love
and
the
faith
that
you have
toward
the
Lord
Jesus
and
toward
all
the
saints
so that
the
fellowship
of the
faith
of you
effective
might become
in
[the] acknowledgment
of every
good [thing]
that [is]
in
us
in
Christ
Joy
for
great
I have
and
encouragement
by occasion of
the
love
of you
because
the
hearts
of the
saints
have been refreshed
by
you
brother
Therefore
much
in
Christ
boldness
having
to order
you
what [is]
befitting
for the sake of
-
love
rather
I exhort [you]
such a one
being
as
Paul
aged
now
then
also
a prisoner
of Christ
Jesus
I exhort
you
for
-
my
child
whom
I have begotten
in
-
chains
Onesimus
-
once
to you
useless
now
however
both
to you
and
to me
useful
whom
I have sent back
to you
in person
he who
is
-
my
very heart
whom
I
was wishing
with
myself
to keep
so that
on behalf of
you
me
he might serve
in
the
chains
of the
gospel
Apart from
however
-
your
consent
nothing
I wished
to do
so that
not
as
according to
necessity
the
good
of you
may be
but
according to
willingness
Perhaps
for
because of
this
he was separated [from you]
for
a time
so that
eternally
him
you might possess
no longer
as
a slave
but
above
a slave
a brother
beloved
especially
to me
how much
however
more
to you
both
in
[the] flesh
and
in
[the] Lord
If
therefore
me
you consider
a partner
receive
him
as
me
If
however
in any way
he has wronged
you
or
he owes [you]
this
to me
charge
I
Paul
did write
with
my own
hand
I
will repay [it]
that
not
I may say
to you
that
even
yourself
to me
you owe also
Yes
brother
I
from you
may have profit
in
[the] Lord
Refresh
my
-
heart
in
Christ
Being persuaded of
the
obedience
of you
I write
to you
knowing
that
even
above
what
I say
you will do
At the same time
now
also
prepare
for me
a lodging
I hope
for
that
through
the
prayers
of you
I will be granted
to you
Greets
you
Epaphras
-
fellow prisoner
my
in
Christ
Jesus
[as do] Mark
Aristarchus
Demas
[and] Luke
the
fellow workers
of me
The
grace
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
[be] with
the
spirit
of you
In many portions
and
in many ways
long ago
-
God
having spoken
to the
fathers
in
the
prophets
in
last
-
days
these
has spoken
to us
in
[His] Son
whom
He appointed
heir
of all things
through
whom
also
He made
the
ages
who
being
[the] radiance
of [His]
glory
and
[the] exact expression
of the
substance
of Him
upholding
then
-
all things
by the
word
of the
power
of Himself
[the] purification
-
of sins
having made
sat down
at
[the] right hand
of the
Majesty
on
high
By so much
superior
having become
to the
angels
as much as
more excellent
beyond
theirs
He has inherited
a name
To which
for
did He say
ever
of the
angels
Son
of me
are
You
I
today
have begotten
You
And
again
I
will be
to Him
for
a Father
and
He
will be
to Me
for
a Son
When
then
again
He brings
the
Firstborn
into
the
world
He says
And
let worship
Him
all
[the] angels
of God
And
as to
indeed
the
angels
He says
The [One]
making
the
angels
of Him
winds
and
the
ministers
of Him
of fire
a flame
Unto
however
the
Son
The
throne
of You
O
God
[is] to
the
age
of the
age
and
the
scepter
of
righteousness [is]
[the] scepter
of the
kingdom
of You
You have loved
righteousness
and
have hated
wickedness
because of
this
has anointed
You
-
God
the
God
of You
with [the] oil
of exultation
above
the
companions
of You
And
You
in
[the] beginning
Lord
of the
earth
laid the foundation
and
works
of the
hands
of You
are
the
heavens
They
will perish
You
however
remain
and
all
like
a garment
will grow old
and
like
a robe
You will roll up
them
like
a garment
also
they will be changed
You
however
the
same
are
and
the
years
of You
not
will never end
To
which
now
of the
angels
did He say
ever
Sit
at
[the] right hand
of Me
until
-
I may place
the
enemies
of You
[as] a footstool
for the
feet
of You
Not
all
are they
ministering
spirits
for
service
being sent forth
for the sake of
those
being about
to inherit
salvation
Because of
this
it behooves
more abundantly
to give heed
us
to the things
we have heard
lest
ever
we should drift away
If
for
the
by
angels
having been spoken
word
was
unalterable
and
every
transgression
and
disobedience
received
a just
recompense
how
we
will escape
such a great
having neglected
a salvation
which
a commencement
having received
declared
by
the
Lord
by
those
having heard
to
us
it was confirmed
bearing witness
-
God
by signs
together with [them]
and
wonders
and
by various
miracles
and
of [the] Spirit
Holy
distributions
according to
the
of Him
will
Not
for
to angels
did He subject
the
world
that
is coming
of
which
we are speaking
Has testified
however
somewhere
someone
saying
What
is
man
that
You are mindful
of him
or
[the] son
of man
that
You care for
him
You made lower
him
a little
some
than
[the] angels
with glory
and
honor
You crowned
him
all things
You have put in subjection
under
the
feet
of him
In
-
for
subjecting
to him
-
all things
nothing
He left
to him
unsubject
At present
however
not yet
do we see
to Him
-
all things
having been subjected
Who
however
a little
one
than
[the] angels
having been made lower
we see
Jesus
because of
the
suffering
-
of death
with glory
and
with honor
having been crowned
so that
by [the] grace
of God
for
everyone
He might taste
death
It was fitting
for
to Him
for
whom [are]
-
all things
and
by
whom [are]
-
all things
many
sons
to
glory
having brought
the
archetype
of the
salvation
of them
through
sufferings
to make perfect
The [One]
both
for
sanctifying
and
those
being sanctified
of
one
[are] all
for
which
reason
not
He is ashamed
brothers
them
to call
saying
I will declare
the
name
of You
to the
brothers
of Me
in
[the] midst
of [the] congregation
I will sing praises
of you
And
again
I
will be
trusting
in
Him
And
again
Behold
I
and
the
children
whom
to Me
has given
-
God
Since
therefore
the
children
have partaken
of blood
and
of flesh
also
He
likewise
took part in
the
same things
so that
through
[His]
death
He might destroy
the [one]
the
power
holding
-
of death
that
is
the
devil
and
might set free
those
who
fear
of death
through
all
[their time]
to live
subject
were
to slavery
Not
for
surely
[the] angels
He helps
but
[the] seed
of Abraham
He helps
Therefore
it behooved [Him]
in
all things
[His]
brothers
to be made like
so that
a merciful
He might become
and
faithful
high priest
[in] things
relating to
-
God
in order
-
to make propitiation for
the
sins
of the
people
In
that
for
has suffered
He Himself
having been tempted
He is able
those
being tempted
to help
Therefore
brothers
holy
of [the] calling
heavenly
partakers
carefully consider
the
apostle
and
high priest
of the
confession
of us
Jesus
faithful
being
to the [One]
having appointed
Him
as
also
Moses
in
all
the
house
of Him
Of greater
for
He
glory
than
Moses
has been counted worthy
by
so much as
greater
honor
has
than the
house [itself]
the [one]
having built
it
Every
for
house
is built
by
someone
the [One]
however
everything
having built [is]
God
And
Moses
indeed
[was] faithful
in
all
the
house
of Him
as
a servant
unto
a testimony
of the things
going to be spoken
Christ
however
as
[the] Son
over
the
house
of Him
whose
house
are
we
if indeed
[our]
confidence
and
the
boast
of [our]
hope
unto
[the] end
firm
we should hold
Therefore
just as
says
the
Spirit
-
Holy
Today
if
the
voice
of Him
you should hear
not
harden
the
hearts
of you
as
in
the
rebellion
in
the
day
-
of testing
in
the
wilderness
where
tried [Me]
the
fathers
of you
by
testing
and
saw
the
works
of Me
forty
years
Therefore
I was angry
with the
generation
that
and
I said
Always
they go astray
-
in the heart
of them
and
not
have they known
the
ways
of Me
so
I swore
in
the
wrath
of Me
[not]
shall they enter
into
the
rest
of Me
Take heed
brothers
lest
ever
there will be
in
any
of you
a heart
evil
of unbelief
into
-
falling away
from
God
[the] living
But
encourage
other
each
every
day
while
-
-
today
it is called
so that
not
may be hardened
one
of
you
by [the] deceitfulness
-
of sin
Partakers
for
-
of Christ
we have become
if indeed
from the
beginning
the
assurance
unto
[the] end
firm
we should hold
As
-
it is said
Today
if
the
voice
of Him
you should hear
not
harden
the
hearts
of you
as
in
the
rebellion
Who
for
[were those] having heard
rebelled
but
not
all
those
having come
out of
Egypt
by the leading of
Moses
With whom
now
was He indignant
forty
years
[if] not
with those
having sinned
whose
-
bodies
fell
in
the
wilderness
To whom
then
did He swear that
not
shall they enter
into
the
rest
of Him
if
not
to those
having disobeyed
And
we see
that
not
they were able
to enter in
because of
unbelief
We should fear
therefore
lest
ever
left remaining
of the promise
to enter
into
the
rest
of Him
should seem
any
of
you
to have fallen short
And
for
we are [those]
having had the gospel preached
just as
they [did]
but
not
did profit
the
message
of [their]
hearing
them
not
having been united with
the
faith
of those
having heard
We enter
for
into
the
rest
those
having believed
as
He has said
So
I swore
in
the
wrath
of me
Not
shall they enter
into
the
rest
of Me
And yet
the
works
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world
have been finished
He has spoken
for
somewhere
concerning
the
seventh [day]
in this way
And
rested
-
God
on
the
day
-
seventh
from
all
the
works
of Him
And
in
this [passage]
again
[Not]
shall they enter
into
the
rest
of Me
Since
therefore
it remains [for]
some
to enter
into
it
and
those
formerly
having received the good news
not
did enter in
because of
disobedience
again
a certain
He appoints
day
Today
through
David
saying
after
so long
a time
just as
it has been said
Today
if
the
voice
of Him
you shall hear
not
harden
the
hearts
of you
If
for
to them
Joshua
had given rest
not
-
about
another
He would have spoken
after
this
day
So then
there remains
a Sabbath rest
for the
people
-
of God
The [one]
for
having entered
into
the
rest
of Him
also
he
rested
from
the
works
of him
as
from
the
own
-
God [did]
We should be diligent
therefore
to enter
into
that
-
rest
so that
not
by
the
same
anyone
example
should fall
-
of disobedience
Living [is]
for
the
word
-
of God
and
active
and
sharper
than
any
sword
two-edged
even
penetrating
as far as
[the] division
of soul
and
spirit
of joints
and
also
marrows
and
able to judge
[the] thoughts
and
intentions
of [the] heart
And
not
there is
creature
hidden
before
Him
all things
however
[are] uncovered
and
laid bare
to the
eyes
of Him
to
whom
[is] our
-
reckoning
Having
therefore
a high priest
great
having passed through
the
heavens
Jesus
the
Son
-
of God
we should hold firmly
to [our]
confession
Not
for
have we
a high priest
not
being able
to sympathize
with the
weaknesses
of us
[one] having been tempted
however
in
all things
by
the same way
without
sin
We should come
therefore
with
boldness
to the
throne
-
of grace
so that
we may receive
mercy
and
grace
may find
for
in time of need
help
Every
for
high priest
from among
men
being taken
on behalf of
men
is appointed
in things
relating to
-
God
that
he should offer
gifts
both
and
sacrifices
for
sins
to exercise forbearance
being able
with those
being ignorant
and
going astray
since
also
he himself
is encompassed by
weakness
and
because of
this
he is obligated
just as
for
the
people
so
also
for
himself
to offer sacrifices
for
sins
And
not
upon himself
anyone
takes
the
honor
but rather
being called
by
-
God
just as
also
Aaron
So
also
-
Christ
not
Himself
did glorify
to become
a high priest
but
the [One]
having said
to
Him
Son
of Me
are
You
I
today
have begotten
You
Just as
also
in
another [place]
He says
You [are]
a priest
to
the
age
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
[He]
in
the
days
of the
flesh
of Him
prayers
both
and
supplications
to
the [One]
being able
to save
Him
from
death
with
crying
loud
and
tears
having offered up
and
having been heard
because of
-
reverence
though
being
a Son
He learned
from
the things
He suffered
-
obedience
and
having been perfected
He became
to all
those
obeying
Him
[the] author
of salvation
eternal
having been designated
by
-
God
a high priest
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
Concerning
this
[there is] much
from us
-
speech
and
difficult in interpretation
to speak
since
sluggish
you have become
in the
hearings
Even
for
you ought
to be
teachers
by
the
time
again
need of
you have
[one]
to teach
you
what [is]
the
principles
of the
beginning
of the
oracles
-
of God
and
you have become
need
[those] having
of milk
not
of solid
food
Everyone
for
-
partaking [only]
of milk
[is] inexperienced
in [the] word
of righteousness
an infant
for
he is
[for the] mature
however
is
-
solid
food
the [ones]
by
-
constant use
the
senses
training
having
for
distinguishing
good
both
and
evil
Therefore
having left
the
-
beginning
of the
Christ
teaching
to
-
maturity
we should go on
not
again
a foundation
laying
of repentance
from
dead
works
and
faith
in
God
about baptisms
instruction
of laying on
then
of hands
of [the] resurrection
of [the] dead
and
of judgment
eternal
And
this
we will do
if
permits
-
God
[It is] impossible
for
to those
once
having been enlightened
having tasted
then
of the
gift
-
heavenly
and
partakers
having become
of [the] Spirit
Holy
and
[the] goodness
having tasted
of Godâs
word
[the] power
also
[of the] coming
age
and then
having fallen away
again
to restore [them]
to
repentance
crucifying
in themselves
the
Son
-
of God
and
subjecting [Him] to open shame
Land
for
-
having drunk in
the
upon
it
coming
often
rain
and
producing
vegetation
useful
for those
for the sake of
whom
also
it is tilled
partakes
of blessing
from
-
God
[That] bringing forth
however
thorns
and
thistles
[is] worthless
and
a curse
near to
of which
the
end [is]
unto
burning
We are persuaded
however
concerning
you
beloved
of
better [things]
and
[things] accompanying
salvation
if
even
like this
we speak
Not
for
unjust [is]
-
God
to forget
the
work
of you
and
the
love
that
you have shown
toward
the
name
of Him
having ministered
to the
saints
and
[still] ministering
We desire
now
each
of you
the
same
to show
earnestness
toward
the
full assurance
of the
hope
unto
[the] end
so that
not
sluggish
you may be
imitators
however
of those
through
faith
and
patience
inheriting
the
promises
-
For
to Abraham
having made His promise
-
God
since
by
no one
He had
greater
to swear
He swore
by
Himself
saying
If
surely
blessing
I will bless
you
and
multiplying
I will multiply
you
And
thus
having waited patiently
he obtained
the
promise
Men
for
by
[one]
greater
swear
and
of all
their
disputes
an end
for
confirmation
[is] the
oath
in
which
more abundantly
desiring
-
God
to show
to the
heirs
of the
promise
the
unchangeableness
of the
purpose
of Him
guaranteed [it]
by an oath
so that
by
two
things
unchangeable
in
which
[it is] impossible
to lie
[for] God
strong
encouragement
we may have
-
having fled for refuge
to take hold
of the
being set before [us]
hope
which
as
an anchor
we have
of the
soul
sure
both
and
unshakable
and
entering
into
that
within
the
veil
where
[the] forerunner
for
us
has entered
Jesus
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
a high priest
having become
to
the
age
This
for
-
Melchizedek
King
of Salem
priest
-
of God
-
Most High
-
having met
Abraham
returning
from
the
slaughter
of the
kings
and
having blessed
him
[is he] to whom
also
a tenth
of
all
apportioned
Abraham
first
indeed
being translated
king
of righteousness
then
and
also
king
of Salem
which
is
king
of peace
Without father
without mother
without genealogy
neither
beginning
of days
nor
of life
end
having
having been made like
however
the
Son
-
of God
he remains
a priest
unto
-
all time
Consider
now
how great
this one [was]
to whom
a tenth
Abraham
gave
out of
the
best spoils
the
patriarch
And
those
indeed
out from
the
sons
of Levi
the
priestly office
receiving
a commandment
have
to take a tenth
from the
people
according to
the
law
that
is
from the
brothers
of them
though
having come
out of
the
loin
of Abraham
The [one]
however
not
tracing his ancestry
from
them
has collected a tenth
from Abraham
and
the [one]
having
the
promises
has blessed
Apart from
now
all
dispute
the
inferior
by
the
superior
is blessed
And
here
indeed
tithes
dying
men
receive
in that place
however
it is testified
that
he lives on
And
so
a word
to speak
through
Abraham
also
Levi
the [one]
tithes
receiving
paid the tithe
Still
for
in
the
loin
of [his]
father
he was
when
met
him
Melchizedek
If
indeed
then
perfection
by
the
Levitical
priesthood
were
the
people
for
upon
it
had received [the] Law
what
still
need [was there]
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
[for] another
to arise
priest
and
not
according to
the
order
of Aaron
to be named
Being changed
for
of the
priesthood
from
necessity
also
of law
a change
takes place
[He] concerning
whom
for
are said
these things
a tribe
another
belonged to
from
which
no one
has served
at the
altar
[It is] evident
for
that
out of
Judah
has sprung
the
Lord
of us
as to
which
a tribe
concerning
priests
nothing
Moses
spoke
And
more abundantly
yet
evident
it is
if
according to
the
likeness
of Melchizedek
arises
a priest
another
who
not
according to
a law
of a commandment
fleshly
has been constituted
but
according to
[the] power
of a life
indestructible
It is testified
for
-
You [are]
a priest
to
the
age
according to
the
order
of Melchizedek
A putting away
indeed
for
there is
of the preceding
commandment
because of
-
its
weakness
and
uselessness
nothing
for
perfected
the
law
[the] introduction
then
of a better
hope
by
which
we draw near
-
to God
And
to
as much as
not
apart from
an oath
those ones
truly
for
without
an oath
are
priests
becoming
[He]
however
with
an oath
through
the [One]
saying
to
Him
Has sworn
[the] Lord
and
not
will change His mind
You [are]
a priest
to
the
age
By
so much
also
of a better
covenant
has become
[the] guarantee
Jesus
And
those
indeed
many
are
having become
priests
because of
-
by death
being prevented from
continuing
-
But
because of
the
abiding
of Him
to
the
age
a permanent
He holds
-
priesthood
wherefore
also
to save
to
the
uttermost
He is able
those
drawing near
through
Him
-
to God
always
living
for
-
to intercede
for
them
Such
indeed
for us
also
was fitting
a high priest
holy
innocent
undefiled
having been separated
from
-
sinners
and
higher
than the
heavens
having become
who
not
has
every
day
need
as
the
high priests
first
for
the
own
sins
sacrifices
to offer up
then
for those
of the
people
this
for
He did
once for all
Himself
having offered up
The
law
for
men
appoints
as high priests
having
weakness
the
word
however
of the
oath
which [is]
after
the
law
a Son
to
the
age
having been perfected
[The] sum
now
of
the things
being spoken of [is that]
such
we have
a high priest
who
sat down
at
[the] right hand
of the
throne
of the
Majesty
in
the
heavens
in the
holy places
a minister
and
in the
tabernacle
-
true
which
has pitched
the
Lord
not
man
Every
for
high priest
in order
-
to offer
gifts
both
and
sacrifices
is appointed
wherefore [it was]
necessary
to have
something
also
[for] this One
that
He might offer
If
certainly
then
He were
on
earth
not even
-
would He be
a priest
there being
those
offering
according to
law
the
gifts
who
a copy
and
shadow
serve
of the
heavenly
as
was divinely instructed
Moses
being about
to complete
the
tabernacle
See that
for
He says
you shall make
all things
according to
the
pattern
-
having been shown
you
in
the
mountain
Now
however
more excellent
He has obtained
a ministry
as much as
also
of a better
He is
covenant
[the] mediator
which
upon
better
promises
has been enacted
If
for
the
first
that
had been
faultless
not
-
for a second
would have been sought
a place
Finding fault
for
with them
He says
Behold
[the] days
are coming
says
[the] Lord
and
I will ratify
with
the
house
of Israel
and
with
the
house
of Judah
a covenant
new
not
according to
the
covenant
that
I made
with
fathers
of them
in
[the] day
of having taken hold of
by Me
the
hand
of them
to lead
them
out of
[the] land
of Egypt
because
they
not
did continue
in
the
covenant
of Me
and I
disregarded
them
says
[the] Lord
For
this [is]
the
covenant
that
I will make
with the
house
of Israel
after
the
days
those
says
[the] Lord
putting
Laws
of Me
into
the
mind
of them
and
upon
hearts
of them
I will inscribe
them
and
I will be
to them
for
God
and
they
will be
to Me
for
a people
And
no
not
shall they teach
each
the
neighbor
of him
and
each
the
brother
of him
saying
Know
the
Lord
because
all
will know
Me
from
[the] least
to [the]
greatest
of them
because
merciful
I will be
toward the
iniquities
of them
and
the
sins
of them
no
not
I shall remember
more
In
-
saying
new
He has made obsolete
the
first
that
then
growing old
and
aging
[is] near
vanishing
Had
indeed
therefore
also
the
first
regulations
of worship
-
and
a sanctuary
earthly
A tabernacle
for
was prepared
the
first [room]
in
which [were]
-
both
the lampstand
and
the
table
and
of the
presentation
the
bread
which
is called
[the] Holy [Place]
Behind
now
the
second
veil
[was] a tabernacle
-
being called
the Holy
of Holies
[the] golden
having
altar of incense
and
the
ark
of the
covenant
having been covered around
in every part
with gold
in
which
[was the] jar
golden
having
the
manna
and
the
staff
of Aaron
-
having budded
and
the
tablets
of the
covenant
Above
then
it
[were the] cherubim
of glory
overshadowing
the
mercy seat
concerning
which
not
it is
now [the time]
to speak
in
detail
These things
now
thus
having been prepared
into
indeed
the
first
tabernacle
at all times
everything
enter
the
priests
the
sacred services
accomplishing
[Enters] into
however
the
second
once
in the
year
only
the
high priest
not
without
blood
which
he offers
for
himself
and
the
of the
people
sins of ignorance
By this
was signifying
the
Spirit
-
Holy
[that] not yet
has been made manifest
the
into the
holy places
way
still
the
first
tabernacle
having
a standing
which [is]
a symbol
for
the
time
-
present
in
which
gifts
both
and
sacrifices
are offered
not
being able
in regard to
conscience
to make perfect
the [one]
worshiping
[consisting] only
in
foods
and
drinks
and
various
washings
ordinances
of [the] flesh
until
[the] time
of reformation
being imposed
Christ
however
having appeared as
high priest
of the
having come
good things
by
the
greater
and
more perfect
tabernacle
not
made by hands
that
is
not
of this
-
creation
nor
by
blood
of goats
and
calves
through
however
the
own
blood
He entered
once for all
into
the
holy places
eternal
redemption
having obtained
If
for
the
blood
of goats
and
of bulls
and
[the] ashes
of a heifer
sprinkling
the
having been defiled
sanctify [them]
for
the
of the
flesh
purification
how much
more
the
blood
-
of Christ
who
through
[the] Spirit
eternal
Himself
offered
unblemished
-
to God
will purify
the
conscience
of us
from
dead
works
in order
-
to serve
God
[the] living
And
because of
this
of a covenant
new
[the] mediator
He is
so that
death
having taken place
for
redemption
of the
under
the
first
covenant
transgressions
the
promise
might receive
those
having been called
of the
eternal
inheritance
Where
for
[there is] a will
[the] death
[it is] necessary
to establish
of the [one]
having made [it]
A will
for
after
death
[is] affirmed
since
not
at the time
it is in force
when
is living
the [one]
having made [it]
wherefore
neither
the
first
apart from
blood
has been inaugurated
Having been spoken
for
of every
commandment
according to
the
law
by
Moses
to all
the
people
having taken
the
blood
-
of calves
and
-
of goats
with
water
and
wool
scarlet
and
hyssop
itself
both
the
book
and
all
the
people
he sprinkled
saying
This [is]
the
blood
of the
covenant
which
commanded
unto
you
-
God
And
the
tabernacle
then
and
all
the
vessels
of the
ministry
with
blood
likewise
he sprinkled
And
almost
with
blood
all things
are purified
according to
the
law
and
apart from
blood-shedding
not
there is
forgiveness
[It was] necessary
then [for]
the
indeed
representations
of the things
in
the
heavens
with these
to be purified
themselves
however
the
heavenly things
with better
sacrifices
than
these
Not
for
into
made by hands
has entered
holy places
Christ
copies
of the
true [ones]
but
into
itself
-
heaven
now
to appear
in the
presence
-
of God
for
us
nor
that
repeatedly
He should offer
Himself
just as
the
high priest
enters
into
the
holy places
every
year
with
[the] blood
of another
Otherwise
it was necessary for
Him
repeatedly
to have suffered
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world
Now
however
once
in
[the] consummation
of the
ages
for
[the] putting away
of
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of Himself
He has been revealed
And
in
as much as
it is apportioned
-
to men
once
to die
after
then
this
[to face] judgment
so
also
-
Christ
once
having been offered
in order
-
of many
to bear
[the] sins
for
a second time
apart from
sin
will appear
to those
Him
awaiting
for
salvation
A shadow
for
having
the
law
of the
coming
good things
not
themselves
the
form
of the
things
each
year
with the
same
sacrifices
which
they offer
to
the
continuous
never
is able
those
drawing near
to perfect
Otherwise
not
-
would they have ceased
being offered
because of
-
none
having
any longer
conscience
of sins
those
serving
once
having been cleansed
But
in
these
[there is] a reminder
of sins
every
year
Impossible [it is]
indeed
[for the] blood
of bulls
and
of goats
to take away
sins
Therefore
coming
into
the
world
He says
Sacrifice
and
offering
not
You have desired
a body
however
You have prepared
me
Burnt offerings
and
[offerings] for
sin
not
You have delighted in
Then
I said
Behold
I have come
in
[the] scroll
of [the] book
it is written
of
Me
-
to do
-
O God
the
will
of You
Above
saying
-
Sacrifice
and
offering
and
burnt offerings
and
[offerings] for
sin
not
You have desired
nor
have You delighted in
which
according to
[the] Law
are offered
then
He said
Behold
I have come
-
to do
the
will
of You
He takes away
the
first
that
the
second
He might establish
By
that
will
having been sanctified
we are
through
the
offering
of the
body
of Jesus
Christ
once for all
And
every
indeed
priest
stands
every
day
ministering
and
the
same
repeatedly
offering
sacrifices
which
never
are able
to take away
sins
This [One]
however
one
for
sins
having offered
sacrifice
in
-
perpetuity
sat down
at
[the] right hand
-
of God
the
henceforth
awaiting
until
should be placed
the
enemies
of Him
[as] a footstool
for the
feet
of Him
By one
for
offering
He has perfected
for
-
all time
those
being sanctified
Bears witness
now
to us
also
the
Spirit
-
Holy
after
for
-
having said
This [is]
the
covenant
that
I will make
with
them
after
the
days
those
says
[the] Lord
putting
[the] laws
of Me
into
[the] hearts
of them
and
into
the
mind
of them
I will inscribe
them
and
The
sins
of them
and
the
lawless acts
of them
no
not
will I remember
any more
Where
now
forgiveness
of these [is]
no longer [is there]
an offering
for
sin
Having
therefore
brothers
confidence
for
the
entering
the
holy places
by
the
blood
of Jesus
which
He dedicated
for us
a way
new
and
living
through
the
veil
that
is
the
flesh
of Him
and [having]
a priest
great
over
the
house
-
of God
we should draw near
with
a sincere
heart
in
full assurance
of faith
having been sprinkled clean
[our]
hearts
from
a conscience
evil
and
having been washed
[our]
body
with water
pure
We should hold fast
to the
confession
of [our]
hope
firmly
faithful
for [is]
the [One]
having promised
And
we should think
one another
toward
stirring up
to love
and
to good
works
not
forsaking
the
assembling together
of ourselves
as
[is the] custom
with some
but
encouraging [one another]
and
so much
more
as
you see
drawing near
the
Day
[If] willingly
for
sin
we
after [we are]
-
to receive
the
knowledge
of the
truth
no longer
for
sins
remains
a sacrifice
terrifying
however
a certain
expectation
of judgment
and
of fire
fury
to devour
being about
the
adversaries
Having set aside
anyone
[the] law
of Moses
without
mercies
on the basis of
two
or
three
witnesses
he dies
How much
think you
worse
will he deserve
punishment
the [one]
the
Son
-
of God
having trampled upon
and
the
blood
of the
covenant
ordinary
having esteemed
by
which
he was sanctified
and
the
Spirit
-
of grace
having insulted
We know
for
the [One]
having said
Mine
[is] vengeance
I
will repay
and
again
Will judge
[the] Lord
the
people
of Him
[It is] a fearful thing
-
to fall
into
[the] hands
of God
[the] living
Remember
however
the
former
days
in
which
having been enlightened
a great
conflict
you endured
of sufferings
this
indeed
by revilings
both
and
tribulations
being made a spectacle
this
now
partners
of those
thus
passing through [them]
having become
Both
for
with the
prisoners
you sympathized
and
the
plundering
of the
possessions
of you
with
joy
you accepted
knowing
to have
yourselves
a better
possession
and
abiding
Not
throw away
therefore
the
boldness
of you
which
has
a great
reward
Of endurance
for
You have
need
so that
the
will
-
of God
having done
you may receive
the
promise
Yet
for
A little
very
while
the [One]
coming
will come
and
not
will delay
The one
however
righteous
of Mine
by
faith
will live
and
if
he might shrink back
not
takes pleasure
the
soul
of Me
in
him
We
however
not
are
of [those] drawing back
to
destruction
but
of faith
to
[the] preserving
[of the] soul
Is
now
faith
of [things] hoped for
[the] assurance
of things
[the] conviction
not
being seen
In
this
for
were commended
the
ancients
By faith
we understand
to have been formed
the
universe
by [the] word
of God
so that
which
not
from [things]
being visible
the things
being seen
have been made
By faith
a more excellent
sacrifice
Abel
than
Cain
offered
-
to God
through
which
he was testified
to be
righteous
bearing witness
to
the
gifts
of him
-
God
and
through
it
having died
still
he speaks
By faith
Enoch
was translated
-
not
to see
death
and
not
was he found
because
had taken up
him
-
God
Before
for
the
translation
he was commended
to have pleased
-
God
Without
now
faith
[it is] impossible
to please [Him]
To believe
for
it behooves
the one
drawing near
-
to God
that
He exists
and [that]
to those
earnestly seeking out
Him
a rewarder
He becomes
By faith
having been divinely instructed
Noah
concerning
the things
not yet
seen
having been moved with fear
prepared
an ark
for
[the] salvation
of the
household
of him
by
which
he condemned
the
world
and
of the
according to
faith
righteousness [that is]
he became
heir
By faith
being called
Abraham
obeyed
to go out
into
a place
that
he was going
to receive
for
an inheritance
and
went out
not
knowing
where
he is going
By faith
he sojourned
in
[the] land
of the
promise
as [in]
a foreign [country]
in
tents
having dwelt
with
Isaac
and
Jacob
the
joint-heirs
of the
promise
-
same
He was awaiting
for
the
-
foundations
having
city
of which
[the] architect
and
builder [is]
-
God
By faith
also
herself
Sarah
power
for
[the] conception
of seed
received
even
beyond
the opportune
age
since
faithful
she considered
the [One]
having promised
Therefore
also
from
one man
were born
and
he
having been as good as dead
as
the
stars
of
heaven
-
in multitude
and
as
the
sand
-
by
the
shore
of the
sea
-
countless
In
faith
died
these
all
not
having received
the
promises
but
from afar
them
having seen
and
having embraced [them]
and
having confessed
that
strangers
and
sojourners
they are
on
the
earth
Those
for
such things
saying
make manifest
that [their]
own country
they are seeking
And
if
indeed
that
they had been remembering
from
where
they came out
they would have had
-
opportunity
to return
Now
however
a better [one]
they stretch forward to
that
is
a heavenly [one]
Therefore
not
is ashamed of
them
-
God
God
to be called
of them
He has prepared
indeed
for them
a city
By faith
has offered up
Abraham
-
Isaac
Being tested
even
[his]
only begotten son
was offering up
the [one]
the
promises
having received
as to
whom
it was said
-
In
Isaac
will be reckoned
your
offspring
having reasoned
that
even
out from
[the] dead
to raise
able [was]
-
God
from where
him
also
in
a simile
he received
By faith
also
concerning
[the things] coming
blessed
Isaac
-
Jacob
and
-
Esau
By faith
Jacob
dying
each
of the
sons
of Joseph
blessed
and
worshiped
on
the
top
of the
staff
of him
By faith
Joseph
dying
concerning
the
exodus
of the
sons
of Israel
made mention
and
concerning
the
bones
of him
gave instructions
By faith
Moses
having been born
was hidden
three months
by
the
parents
of him
because
they saw
[was] beautiful
the
little child
and
not
they did fear
the
edict
of the
king
By faith
Moses
grown
having become
refused
to be called
[the] son
of [the] daughter
of Pharaoh
rather
having chosen
to suffer affliction with
the
people
-
of God
than
[the] temporary
to have
of sin
enjoyment
greater
wealth
having esteemed
than the
of Egypt
treasures
the
reproach
-
of Christ
he was looking
for
toward
the
reward
By faith
he left
Egypt
not
having feared
the
anger
of the
king
the
for
Invisible [One]
as
seeing
he persevered
By faith
he has kept
the
Passover
and
the
sprinkling
of the
blood
so that
not
the [one]
destroying
the
firstborn
would touch
them
By faith
they passed through
the
Red
Sea
as
through
dry
land
which
an attempt
having made
the
Egyptians
were swallowed up
By faith
the
walls
of Jericho
fell
having been encircled
for
seven
days
By faith
Rahab
the
prostitute
not
did perish with
those
having disobeyed
having received
the
spies
with
peace
And
what
more
shall I say
Will fail
me
for
telling
the
time
of
Gideon
Barak
Samson
Jephthah
David
also
and
Samuel
and
the
prophets
who
by
faith
conquered
kingdoms
administered
justice
obtained
promises
shut
[the] mouths
of lions
quenched
[the] power
of fire
escaped
[the] mouths
of [the] sword
acquired strength
out of
weakness
became
mighty
in
war
[the] armies
put to flight
of foreigners
Received back
women
by
resurrection
the
dead
of them
others
then
were tortured
not
having accepted
-
release
so that
a better
resurrection
they might obtain
Others
then
of mockings
and
of scourgings
trial
received
in addition
also
of chains
and
imprisonment
They were stoned
they were tried
they were sawed in two
by
slaughter
of [the] sword
they were killed
they wandered
in
sheepskins
in
goatsâ
skins
being destitute
being oppressed
being mistreated
of whom
not
was
worthy
the
world
in
deserts
wandering
and
mountains
and
caves
and
-
holes
of the
earth
And
these
all
having been commended
through
the
faith
not
did receive
the
promise
-
God
for
us
better
something
having planned
so that
not
apart from
us
they should be made perfect
Therefore
also
we
such a great
having
encompassing
us
a cloud
of witnesses
weight
having laid aside
every
and
the
easily entangling
sin
with
endurance
should run
the
lying before
us
race
looking
to
the
of [our]
faith
founder
and
perfecter
Jesus
who
in view of
the
lying before
Him
joy
endured
[the] cross
[its] shame
having despised
at
right hand
and
of the
throne
-
of God
sat down
Consider fully
for
the [One]
such great
having endured
from
-
sinners
against
Himself
hostility
so that
not
you shall grow weary
in the
souls
of you
fainting
Not yet
unto
blood
have you resisted
against
-
sin
struggling
and
you have forgotten
the
exhortation
that
you
as
to sons
addresses
Son
of Me
not
regard lightly
[the] discipline
of [the] Lord
nor
faint
by
Him
being reproved
Whom
for
He loves
[the] Lord
disciplines
He scourges
now
every
son
whom
He receives
As
discipline
endure
as
sons
you
is treating
-
God
what
for
son [is there]
whom
not
disciplines
[his] father
If
however
without
you are
of discipline
of which
partakers
they have become
all
then
illegitimate children
and
not
sons
you are
Furthermore
-
indeed
of the
flesh
of us
fathers
we have had
correctors
and
we respected [them]
not
much
more
shall we be in subjection
to the
Father
-
of spirits
and
shall live
-
Truly
indeed
for
a few
days
according to
that
seeming good
to them
they were disciplining [us]
-
but [He]
for
[our]
benefitting
in order
-
to share
of the
holiness
of Him
All
now
discipline
for
indeed
those
being present
not
seems
of joy
to be
but
of grief
afterward
however
[the] fruit
peaceable
to those
by
it
having been trained
it yields
of righteousness
Therefore
the
drooping
hands
and
the
enfeebled
knees
lift up
and
paths
straight
make
for the
feet
of you
so that
not
the
lame
should be put out of joint
should be healed
however
rather
Peace
pursue
with
all
and
-
holiness
which
without
no one
will see
the
Lord
observing
lest
any
be failing
of
the
grace
-
of God
lest
any
root
of bitterness
up
springing
should trouble [you]
and
by
this
might be defiled
the
many
lest [there be]
any
fornicator
or
profane person
as
Esau
who
for
meal
one
sold
the
birthright
of himself
You know
for
that
even
afterward
wishing
to inherit
the
blessing
he was rejected
of repentance
for
place
not
he found
although
with
tears
having earnestly sought
it
Not
for
you have come to
[that] being touched
and
having been kindled
with fire
and
to darkness
and
to gloom
and
to storm
and
of a trumpet
to [the] sound
and
to a voice
of words
which
those
having heard
excused themselves
[asking] not
to be addressed
to them
[the] word
not
they could bear
for
that
being commanded
If even
a beast
should touch
the
mountain
it shall be stoned
And
so
fearful
was
the thing
appearing [that]
Moses
said
Greatly afraid
I am
and
trembling
But
you have come to
Zion
Mount
and
[the] city
of God
[the] living
[the] Jerusalem
heavenly
and
to myriads
of angels
[to the] assembly
and
to [the] church
of [the] firstborn
having been enrolled
in
[the] heavens
and
to [the] judge
God
of all
and
to [the] spirits
of [the] righteous
having been perfected
and
of a covenant
new
[the] mediator
to Jesus
and
to [the] blood
of sprinkling
better things
speaking
than
that of
Abel
Take heed
lest
you refuse
the [One]
speaking
If
for
they
not
escaped
on
earth
having refused
the [One]
divinely instructing [them]
much
less
we
-
the [One]
from
[the] heavens
turning away from
whose
-
voice
the
earth
shook
at that time
now
however
He has promised
saying
Yet
once [more]
I
will shake
not
only
the
earth
but
also
-
heaven
This
now
Yet
once [more]
signifies
the
of the [things]
being shaken
removing
as
having been created
so that
should remain
the things
not
being shaken
Therefore
a kingdom
not to be shaken
receiving
we may have
grace
by
which
we may serve
well pleasingly
-
God
with
reverence
and
awe
Also
for
the
God
of us
[is] a fire
consuming
-
Brotherly love
let abide
-
Of hospitality
not
be forgetful
through
this
for
unawares
some
have entertained
angels
Remember
-
prisoners
as
being bound with [them]
those
being mistreated
as
also
yourselves
being
in
[the] body
Honorable [let]
-
marriage [be]
in
all
and
the
marriage bed
undefiled
the sexually immoral
for
and
adulterers
will judge
-
God
[Let be] without covetousness
[your]
manner of life
being satisfied
with the
present
He Himself
for
has said
Never
not
you
will I leave
nor
never
not
you
will I forsake
So
are confident
we
to say
[The] Lord [is]
my
helper
not
I will be afraid
what
shall do
to me
man
Remember
those
leading
you
who
spoke
to you
the
word
-
of God
of whom
considering
the
outcome
of [their]
way of life
imitate
the
faith
Jesus
Christ
yesterday
and
today
[is] the
same
and
to
the
ages
By teachings
various
and
strange
not
be carried away
[it is] good
for
by grace
to be strengthened
for the
heart
not
foods
in
which
not
were profited
those
being devoted
We have
an altar
from
which
to eat
not
have
authority
those
in the
tabernacle
serving
Whose
for
is brought
of animals
the
blood [as sacrifices]
for
sin
into
the
holy places
by
the
high priest
of those
the
bodies
are burned
outside
the
camp
Therefore
also
Jesus
so that
he might sanctify
by
the
own
blood
the
people
outside
the
gate
suffered
Therefore
we should go forth
to
Him
outside
the
camp
the
reproach
of Him
bearing
Not
for
we have
here
an abiding
city
but
the
coming [one]
we are seeking for
Through
Him
then
we should offer
[the] sacrifice
of praise
through
everything
to
God
that
is
[the] fruit
of [the] lips
confessing
the
name
of Him
-
And
the good
and
of sharing
not
be forgetful
with such
for
sacrifices
is well pleased
-
God
Obey
those
leading
you
and
be submissive
they
for
watch
over
the
souls
of you
as
account
about to give
that
with
joy
this
they might do
and
not
groaning
unprofitable
indeed
for you [is]
this
Pray
for
us
we are persuaded
for
that
a good
conscience
we have
in
all things
well
desiring
to conduct ourselves
More abundantly
now
I exhort [you]
this
to do
so that
more quickly
I may be restored
to you
[May] the
now
God
-
of peace
-
having brought
out from
[the] dead
the
Shepherd
of the
sheep
-
great
by
[the] blood
of [the] covenant
eternal
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
equip
you
in
everything
good
in order
-
to do
the
will
of Him
working
in
us
that which [is]
well pleasing
before
Him
through
Jesus
Christ
to whom [be]
the
glory
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
I exhort
now
you
brothers
bear with
the
word
-
of exhortation
only
for
in
few words
I have written
to you
You know
the
brother
of us
Timothy
has been released
with
whom
if
sooner
he should come
I will see
you
Greet
all
those
leading
you
and
all
the
saints
Greet
you
those
from
-
Italy
-
Grace [be]
with
all
of you
James
of God
and
of [the] Lord
Jesus
Christ
a servant
To the
twelve
tribes
-
in
the
Dispersion
Greetings
All
joy
esteem [it]
brothers
of me
when
trials
you might fall into
various
knowing
that
the
testing
of your
-
faith
produces
endurance
-
And
endurance
work
[its] perfect
let have
so that
you may be
perfect
and
complete
in
nothing
lacking
If
now
any
of you
lacks
wisdom
let him ask
from
the [One]
giving
God
to all
generously
and
not
finding fault
and
it will be given
to him
Let him ask
however
in
faith
nothing
doubting
The [one]
for
doubting
is like
a wave
of [the] sea
being blown by the wind
and
being tossed by the wind
Not
for
let suppose
the
man
that
that
he will receive
anything
from
the
Lord
[He is] a man
double-minded
unstable
in
all
the
ways
of him
Let boast
however
the
brother
-
of low degree
in
the
exaltation
of him
he who [is]
then
rich
in
the
humiliation
of him
because
like
a flower
of grass
he will pass away
Has risen
for
the
sun
with
[its]
burning heat
and
withered
the
grass
and
the
flower
of it
has fallen
and
the
beauty
of the
appearance
of it
has perished
Thus
also
the
rich [man]
in the midst of
the
pursuits
of him
will fade away
Blessed [is the]
man
who
endures
trial
because
approved
having been
he will receive
the
crown
-
of life
that
He has promised
to those
loving
Him
No one
being tempted
let say
-
By
God
I am being tempted
-
For
God
unable to be tempted
is
by evils
tempts
now
He Himself
no one
A man
however
is tempted
by
the
own
desire
being drawn away
and
being enticed
Then
-
desire
having conceived
gives birth to
sin
-
and
sin
having become fully grown
brings forth
death
Not
be misled
brothers
my
beloved
Every
act of giving
good
and
every
gift
perfect
from above
is
coming down
from
the
Father
-
of lights
with
whom
not
there is
variation
or
of shifting
shadow
Having willed [it]
He brought forth
us
by [the] word
of truth
for
-
to be
us
firstfruits
a certain
-
of His
creatures
Know [this]
brothers
my
beloved
Let be
however
every
man
swift
unto
-
to hear
slow
unto
-
to speak
slow
unto
anger
[the] anger
for
of man
[the] righteousness
of God
not
produces
Therefore
having put aside
all
filthiness
and
abounding
of wickedness
in
humility
receive
the
implanted
word
-
being able
to save
the
souls
of you
Be
however
doers
of [the] word
and
not
hearers
only
deceiving
yourselves
because
if
anyone
a hearer
of [the] word
is
and
not
a doer
this one
is like
a man
looking
at
[the] face
-
natural
of him
in
a mirror
he has viewed
for
himself
and
has gone away
and
immediately
he has forgotten
what like
he was
The [one]
however
having looked intently
into
[the] law
perfect
that
-
of freedom
and
having continued in [it]
not
a hearer
forgetful
having been
but
a doer
of [the] work
this one
blessed
in
the
work
of him
will be
If
anyone
seems
religious
to be
not
bridling
[the] tongue
of himself
but
deceiving
[the] heart
of himself
of this one
worthless [is]
the
religion
Religion
pure
and
undefiled
before
the
God
and
Father
this
is
to visit
orphans
and
widows
in
the
tribulation
of them
unstained
oneself
to keep
from
the
world
Brothers
of Me
not
with
partiality
hold
the
faith
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
-
of glory
If
for
might come
into
assembly
of you
a man
with a gold ring
in
apparel
splendid
might come in
then
also
a poor [man]
in
shabby
apparel
you should look
also
upon
the [one]
wearing
the
apparel
-
splendid
and
should say
You
sit you
here
honorably
and
to the
poor
should say
You
stand
there
or
Sit
under
the
footstool
of me
not
have you made a distinction
among
yourselves
and
have become
judges [with]
thoughts
evil
Listen
brothers
my
beloved
Not
-
God
has chosen
the
poor
-
in this world
[to be] rich
in
faith
and
heirs
of the
kingdom
that
He promised
to those
loving
Him
You
however
have dishonored
the
poor
Not
the
rich
are oppressing
you
and
they
dragging
you
into
court
Not
they
are blaspheming
the
good
Name
-
having been called
upon
you
If
indeed
[the] law
you keep
royal
according to
the
Scripture
You shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
well
you are doing
If
however
you show partiality
sin
you are committing
being convicted
by
the
law
as
transgressors
Whoever
for
all
the
law
shall keep
shall stumble
but
in
one [point]
he has become
of all
guilty
The [One]
for
having said
Not
you shall commit adultery
said
also
Not
you shall murder
If
however
not
you do commit adultery
do commit murder
however
you have become
a transgressor
of [the] law
So
speak
and
so
act
as
by
[the] law
of freedom
being about
to be judged
-
For
judgment
without mercy [will be]
to the [one]
not
having shown
mercy
Triumphs over
mercy
judgment
What [is]
the
profit
brothers
of me
if
faith
says
anyone
to have
works
however
not
he has
Not
is able
the
faith
to save
him
Now if
a brother
or
a sister
without clothes
is
and
lacking
-
of daily
food
says
then
anyone
to them
out from
you
Go
in
peace
be warmed
and
be filled
not
gives
however
to them
the
needful things
for the
body
what [is]
the
profit
So
also
-
faith
if
not
it has
works
dead
is
by
itself
But
will say
someone
You
faith
have
and I
works
have
Show
me
the
faith
of you
without
-
works
and I
you
will show
by
the
works
of me
-
faith
You
believe
that
one
is
-
God
Well
you are doing
Even
the
demons
believe [that]
and
shudder
Do you want
however
to come to know
O
man
foolish
that
-
faith
apart from
-
works
worthless
is
Abraham
the
father
of us
not
by
works
was justified
having offered
Isaac
the
son
of him
upon
the
altar
You see
that
[his]
faith
was working with
the
works
of him
and
by
[his]
works
[his]
faith
was perfected
And
was fulfilled
the
Scripture
-
saying
Believed
then
Abraham
-
God
and
it was counted
to him
for
righteousness
and
a friend
of God
he was called
You see
that
by
works
is justified
a man
and
not
by
faith
alone
Likewise
then
also
Rahab
the
prostitute
not
by
works
was justified
having received
the
messengers
and
by another
way
having sent [them] forth
Just as
for
the
body
apart from
spirit
dead
is
so
also
-
faith
apart from
works
dead
is
Not
many [of you]
teachers
let be
brothers
of mine
knowing
that
greater
judgment
we will receive
In many ways
for
we stumble
all
If
anyone
in
what he says
not
does stumble
this one [is]
a perfect
man
able
to bridle
indeed
all
the
body
If
now
of the
horses
-
bits
into
the
mouths
we put
for
-
to obey
them
us
even
all
the
body
of them
we turn about
Behold
also
the
ships
so great
being
and
by
winds
strong
being driven
are turned about
by
a very small
rudder
wherever
the
impulse
of the [one]
steering
resolves
Thus
also
the
tongue
a small
member
is
and
exceeding things
it boasts
Behold
a small
fire
how great
a forest
it kindles
Also
the
tongue [is]
a fire
the
world
-
of iniquity
The
tongue
is set
among
the
members
of us
-
defiling
all
the
body
and
setting on fire
the
course
-
of nature
and [itself]
being set on fire
by
-
hell
All
for
kinds
of beasts
both
and
of birds
of creeping things
both
and
things of the sea
is subdued
and
has been subdued
by the
race
of the
human
-
but
the tongue
no one
to subdue
is able
of men
[it is] an unruly
evil
full
of poison
deadly
With
it
we bless
our
Lord
and
Father
and
with
it
we curse
-
men
those
according to
[the] likeness
of God
being made
Out of
the
same
mouth
proceed forth
blessing
and
cursing
Not
ought
brothers
of Me
these things
so
to be
Not
the
spring
out
of the
same
opening
pours forth
-
[both] fresh
and
-
bitter
Not
is able
brothers
of me
a fig tree
olives
to produce
Or
a vine
figs
Nor
a salt [spring]
fresh
to produce
water
Who
[is] wise
and
understanding
among
you
let him show
out of
the
good
conduct
the
works
of him
in
[the] humility
of wisdom
If
however
jealousy
bitter
you have
and
self-interest
in
the
heart
of you
not
boast [of it]
and
lie
against
the
truth
Not
is
this
the
wisdom
from above
coming down
but
[is] earthly
unspiritual
demonic
Where
for
jealousy
and
self-interest [exist]
there [will be]
disorder
and
every
evil
thing
-
But
the from above
wisdom
first
indeed
pure
is
then
peaceable
gentle
reasonable
full
of mercy
and
of fruits
good
impartial
sincere
[The] fruit
now
of righteousness
in
peace
is sown
by those
making
peace
From where
[come] disputes
and
from where
quarrels
among
you
[Is it] not
from there
out of
the
passions
of you
-
warring
in
the
members
of you
You desire
and
not
have
you kill
and
covet
and
not
are able
to obtain
You quarrel
and
wrangle
Not
you have
because
-
not
ask
you
You ask
and
not
receive
because
wrongly
you ask
that
in
the
pleasures
of you
you may spend [it]
Adulteresses
Not
know you
that
the
friendship
with the
world
hostility
[with]
God
is
Whoever
if
therefore
has chosen
a friend
to be
of the
world
an enemy
-
of God
is appointed
Or
think you
that
in vain
the
Scripture
says
With
envy
yearns
the
Spirit
that
He has made to dwell
in
us
Greater
however
He gives
grace
Therefore
it says
-
God
[the] proud
opposes
to [the] humble
however
gives
grace
Subject yourselves
therefore
-
to God
Resist
however
the
devil
and
he will flee
from
you
Draw near
-
to God
and
He will draw near
to you
Cleanse
[your] hands
[you] sinners
and
have purified
hearts
[you] double-minded
Be grieved
and
mourn
and
weep
The
laughter
of you
to
mourning
let be turned
and
the
joy
to
gloom
Humble yourselves
in the presence of
[the] Lord
and
He will exalt
you
Not
speak against
one another
brothers
The [one]
speaking against
[his] brother
or
judging
the
brother
of him
speaks against
[the] Law
and
judges
[the] Law
If
however
[the] Law
you judge
not
you are
a doer
of [the] Law
but
a judge
One
there is
Lawgiver
and
Judge
the [One]
being able
to save
and
to destroy
You
however
who
are
-
judging
the
neighbor
Come
now
those
saying
Today
or
tomorrow
we will go
into
such
-
city
and
will spend
there
a year
and
will trade
and
will make a profit
who
not
know
on the
next day [is]
What [is]
the
life
of you
A vapor
just
it is
-
for
a little [while]
appearing
then
also
vanishing
Instead [ought]
-
to say
you
If
the
Lord
should will
both
we will live
and
we will do
this
or
that
Now
however
you boast
in
the
arrogance
of you
All
boasting
such
evil
is
To [him] knowing
therefore
good
to do
and
not
doing
sin
to him
it is
Come
now
[you]
rich
weep
wailing
over
the
miseries
upon you
that [are]
coming
The
riches
of You
have rotted
and
the
garments
of you
moth-eaten
have become
The
gold
of you
and
the
silver
have corroded
and
the
rust
of them
for
a testimony
against you
will be
and
will eat
the
flesh
of you
like
fire
You have treasured up
in
[the] last
days
Behold
the
wage
of the
workmen
-
having harvested
the
fields
of you
-
having been kept back
by
you
cries out
and
the
cries
of those
having harvested
into
the
ears
of [the] Lord
of Hosts
have entered
You lived in luxury
upon
the
earth
and
lived in self-indulgence
You have fattened
the
hearts
of you
in
[the] day
of slaughter
You have condemned
[and] have put to death
the
righteous
not
does he resist
you
Be patient
therefore
brothers
until
the
coming
of the
Lord
Behold
the
farmer
awaits
the
precious
fruit
of the
earth
being patient
for
it
until
it receives
[the] early
and
latter [rains]
Be patient
also
you
strengthen
the
hearts
of you
because
the
coming
of the
Lord
has drawn near
Not
grumble
brothers
against
one another
so that
not
you may be condemned
Behold
the
Judge
before
the
doors
is standing
[As] an example
take
brothers
-
of suffering evils
and
-
of patience
the
prophets
who
spoke
in
the
name
of [the] Lord
Behold
we count blessed
those
having persevered
The
perseverance
of Job
you have heard of
and
the
outcome
from [the] Lord
you have seen
that
full of compassion
is
the
Lord
and
[is] merciful
Before
all things
however
brothers
of me
not
swear
neither [by]
-
heaven
nor
the
earth
nor
other
any
oath
Be
however
of you
the
Yes
yes
and
the
No
no
so that
not
under
judgment
you might fall
Is suffering hardships
anyone
among
you
Let him pray
Is cheerful
anyone
Let him sing praises
Is sick
anyone
among
you
Let him call near
the
elders
of the
church
and
let them pray
over
him
having anointed
with oil
in
the
name
of the
Lord
And
the
prayer
-
of faith
will save
the one
ailing
and
will raise up
him
the
Lord
and if
sins
he might be [one]
having committed
it will be forgiven
him
Confess
therefore
to one another
the
sins
and
pray
for
one another
so that
you may be healed
Much
prevails
[the] prayer
of a righteous [man]
being made effective
Elijah
a man
was
of like nature
to us
and
with fervent prayer
he prayed [for it]
-
not
to rain
and
not
it did rain
upon
the
earth
years
three
and
months
six
And
again
he prayed
and
the
heaven
rain
gave
and
the
earth
produced
the
fruit
of it
Brothers
of Me
if
anyone
among
you
might wander
from
the
truth
and
should bring back
someone
him
let him know
that
the [one]
having brought back
a sinner
from
[the] error
of the way
of him
will save
the soul
of him
from
death
and
will cover over
a multitude
of sins
Peter
an apostle
of Jesus
Christ
To [the] elect
sojourners
of [the] Dispersion
of Pontus
Galatia
Cappadocia
Asia
and
Bithynia
according to
[the] foreknowledge
of God
[the] Father
by
[the] sanctification
of [the] Spirit
unto
[the] obedience
and
sprinkling
of [the] blood
of Jesus
Christ
Grace
to you
and
peace
may be multiplied
Blessed [be]
the
God
and
Father
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the [One]
according to
the
great
of Him
mercy
having begotten again
us
to
a hope
living
through
[the] resurrection
of Jesus
Christ
out from
[the] dead
to
an inheritance
imperishable
and
undefiled
and
unfading
being reserved
in
[the] heavens
for
you
who
by
[the] power
of God
[are] being guarded
through
faith
for
[the] salvation
ready
to be revealed
in
[the] time
last
in
which
you greatly rejoice
for a little while
at present
if
being necessary
having been put to grief
by
various
trials
so that
the
proven genuineness
of your
-
faith
more precious
than gold
-
perishing
by
fire
though
being refined
may be discovered
to result in
praise
and
glory
and
honor
in
[the] revelation
of Jesus
Christ
whom
not
having seen
you love
on
whom
now [though]
not
seeing
believing
now
you exult
with joy
inexpressible
and
filled with glory
receiving
the
outcome
of the
faith
[the] salvation
of [your] souls
Concerning
this
salvation
sought out
and
searched out diligently
[the] prophets
-
of
the
toward
you
grace
having prophesied
inquiring
into
what
or
what manner of
time
was signifying
the
in
them
Spirit
of Christ
testifying beforehand
-
unto
Christ's
sufferings
and
the
after
these
glories
to whom
it was revealed
that
not
themselves
you
however
they were serving
in those things
which
now
have been proclaimed
to you
by
those
having proclaimed the gospel to
you
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
having been sent
from
heaven
into
which
desire
angels
to look
Therefore
having girded up
the
loins
of the
mind
of you
being sober-minded
fully
set [your] hope
upon
the
being brought
to you
grace
in
[the] revelation
of Jesus
Christ
as
children
of obedience
not
fashioning yourselves
to the
former
in
the
ignorance
of you
desires
But
as
the [One]
having called
you
[is] holy
also
yourselves
holy
in
all
[your] conduct
be
because
it has been written
Holy
you shall be
because
I
holy
And
if
[as] Father
you call on
the [One]
impartially
judging
according to
the
of each
work
in
fear
during the
of the
sojourn
of you
time
conduct yourselves
knowing
that
not
by perishable things
by silver
or
by gold
you were redeemed
from
the
futile
of you
manner of life
handed down from [your] fathers
but
by [the] precious
blood
as
of a lamb
without blemish
and
without spot
of Christ
having been foreknown
indeed
before
[the] foundation
of [the] world
having been revealed
however
in
[the] last
-
times
for the sake of
you
who
by
Him
believe
in
God
the [one]
having raised up
Him
out from
[the] dead
and
glory
Him
having given
so as for
the
faith
of you
and
hope
to be
in
God
The
souls
of you
having purified
by
-
obedience
to the
truth
unto
brotherly love
sincere
out of
of heart
one another
love
fervently
Having been born again
not
of
seed
perishable
but
of imperishable
by
[the] word
living
of God
and
abiding
because
All
flesh [is]
like
grass
and
all
[the] glory
of it
like
[the] flower
of grass
Withers
the
grass
and
the
flower
falls away
-
but
the word
of [the] Lord
abides
to
the
age
This
now
is
the
word
-
having been proclaimed
to
you
Having put aside
therefore
all
malice
and
all
deceit
and
hypocrisy
and
envies
and
all
evil speakings
like
newborn
babies
-
reasonable
pure
milk
crave
so that
by
it
you may grow up
in respect to
salvation
if indeed
you have tasted
that
[is] good
the
Lord
To
whom
coming
a stone
living
by
men
indeed
rejected
in the sight of
however
God
chosen
[and] precious
also
you yourselves
as
stones
living
are being built up
as a house
spiritual
into
a priesthood
holy
to offer
spiritual
sacrifices
acceptable
to God
through
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
it is contained
in
Scripture
Behold
I lay
in
Zion
a stone
a chosen
cornerstone
precious
and
the [one]
believing
on
Him
no
not
shall be put to shame
To you
therefore [is]
the
preciousness
-
believing
[to those] disobeying
however
[The] stone
which
have rejected
those
building
this
has become
into
[the] head
of [the] corner
and
A stone
of stumbling
and
a rock
of offense
[They]
stumble at
to the
word
being disobedient
to
which
also
they were appointed
You
however
[are] a race
chosen
a royal
priesthood
a nation
holy
a people
for [His]
possession
so that
the
excellencies
you may proclaim
of the [One]
out of
darkness
you
having called
to
the
marvelous
of Him
light
who
once [were]
not
a people
now
however
[the] people
of God
those
not
having received mercy
now
however
having received mercy
Beloved
I exhort [you]
as
aliens
and
sojourners
to abstain
from
fleshly
desires
which
war
against
the
soul
the
conduct
of you
among
the
Gentiles
keeping
honorable
so that
wherein
which
they speak against
you
as
evildoers
through
the
good
deeds
having witnessed
they may glorify
-
God
in
[the] day
of visitation
Be in subjection
to every
human
institution
for the sake of
the
Lord
whether
to [the] king
as
being supreme
or
to governors
as
by
him
being sent
for
vengeance
to evildoers
praise
then
to well doers
because
this
is
the
will
-
of God
doing good
to put to silence
the
-
of foolish
men
ignorance
as
free
and
not
as
a cover-up
having
for
evil
the
freedom
but
as
of God
servants
Everyone
honor
The
brotherhood
love
-
God
fear
the
king
honor
-
Servants
be subject
with
all
fear
to
masters
not
only
to the
good
and
gentle
but
also
to the
unreasonable
This
for
[is] acceptable
if
for sake of
conscience
toward God
endures
anyone
griefs
suffering
unjustly
What kind of
for
credit [is it]
if
sinning
and
being struck
you shall endure
But
if
doing good
and
suffering
you shall endure
this [is]
commendable
before
God
To this
hereunto
for
you have been called
because
also
Christ
suffered
for
you
you
leaving
an example
that
you should follow after
the
steps
of Him
Who
sin
not
committed
neither
was found
trickery
in
the
mouth
of Him
Who
being reviled
not
reviled in return
suffering
not
threatened
He gave [Himself] over
however
to Him
judging
justly
Who
the
sins
of us
Himself
bore
in
the
body
of Him
on
the
tree
so that
-
to sins
having been dead
-
to righteousness
we might live
By whose
-
wounds
you have been healed
You were
for
like
sheep
going astray
but
you have returned
now
to
the
Shepherd
and
Overseer
of the
souls
of you
Likewise
wives
be subject
to the
own
husbands
so that
even
if
any
are disobedient
to the
word
by
the
of the
wives
conduct
without
word
they will be won over
having witnessed
the
in
respect
pure
conduct
of you
whose
let it be
not
the
external
of braiding
of hair
and
putting around
of gold
or
putting on
of garments
adorning
but
the
hidden
of the
heart
man
in
the
imperishable
of the
gentle
and
quiet
spirit
which
is
before
-
God
of great worth
In this way
for
formerly
also
the
holy
women
-
hoping
in
God
used to adorn
themselves
being subject
to the
own
husbands
as
Sarah
obeyed
-
Abraham
lord
him
calling
of whom
you have become
children
doing good
and
not
fearing
not one
consternation
-
Husbands
likewise
dwelling with [them]
according to
knowledge
as
with a weaker
vessel
with the
female
rendering
honor
as
also
joint-heirs
of [the] grace
of life
so as for
-
not
to be hindered
the
prayers
of you
-
Now
the end
All [be]
single-minded
sympathetic
loving as brothers
tender-hearted
humble
not
repaying
evil
for
evil
or
insult
for
insult
on the contrary
however
blessing
because
to
this
you were called
so that
blessing
you should inherit
The [one]
for
desiring
life
to love
and
to see
days
good
let him keep
the
tongue
from
evil
and
lips
-
not
to speak
deceit
Let him turn away
also
from
evil
and
let him do
good
Let him seek
peace
and
let him pursue
it
Because
[the] eyes
of [the] Lord
[are] on
[the] righteous
and
[the] ears
of Him
toward
prayer
of them
[The] face
however
of [the] Lord
[is] against
those doing
evil
And
who [is]
he who
will harm
you
if
for that which [is]
good
zealous
you should be
But
if
even
you should suffer
because of
righteousness
[you are] blessed
-
And
the threats
of them
not
you should be afraid of
neither
should you be troubled
[As] Lord
however
-
Christ
sanctify
in
the
hearts
of you
ready
always
for
a defense
to everyone
-
asking
you
an account
concerning
the
in
you
hope
yet
with
gentleness
and
fear
a conscience
having
good
so that
in
this
they might speak against you
they shall be ashamed
those
reviling
your
-
good
in
Christ
manner of life
[It is] better
for
doing good
if
wills [it]
the
will
-
of God
to suffer
than
doing evil
because
also
Christ
once
for
sins
suffered
[the] righteous
for
[the] unrighteous
so that
you
He might bring
-
to God
having been put to death
indeed
in [the] flesh
having been made alive
however
in [the] spirit
in
which
also
to the
in
prison
spirits
having gone
He preached
having disobeyed
at one time
when
was waiting
the
-
of God
longsuffering
in
[the] days
of Noah
being prepared
of [the] ark
in
which
a few
that
is
eight
souls
were saved
through
water
which
also
you
prefigures
now
saving
baptism
not
of flesh
a putting away
of [the] filth
but
of a conscience
good
[the] demand
toward
God
through
[the] resurrection
of Jesus
Christ
who
is
at
[the] right hand
of God
having gone
into
heaven
having been subjected
to Him
angels
and
authorities
and
powers
Christ
therefore
having suffered
in [the] flesh
also
you
the
same
mind
arm yourselves with
because
the [one]
having suffered
[in the] flesh
is done with
sin
so as
-
no longer
to menâs
desires
but
to [the] will
of God
the
remaining
in
[the] flesh
to live
time
[Is] sufficient
for
the
past
time
the
desire
of the
Gentiles
to have carried out
having walked
in
sensuality
lusts
drunkenness
orgies
carousing
and
abominable
idolatries
With respect to
this
they think it strange
not
running with [them]
of you
into
the
same
-
of debauchery
overflow
speaking evil [of you]
who
will give
account
to Him who
ready
is
to judge
[the] living
and
[the] dead
To
this [end]
indeed
even
to [the] dead
the gospel was proclaimed
so that
they might be judged
indeed
according to
men
in [the] flesh
they might live
however
according to
God
in [the] spirit
Of all
now
the
end
has drawn near
Be clear minded
therefore
and
sober
for the purpose of
prayers
above
all things
-
among
yourselves
love
fervent
having
because
love
covers over
a multitude
of sins
hospitable
to
one another
without
complaint
each
as
has received
a gift
to
each other
them
serving
as
good
stewards
of [the] manifold
grace
of God
if
anyone
speaks
as
oracles
of God
if
anyone
serves
as
of
strength
which
supplies
-
God
so that
in
all things
may be glorified
-
God
through
Jesus
Christ
to whom
be
the
glory
and
the
power
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
Beloved
not
be surprised at
the
among
you
fire
for
a trial
to you
taking place
as if
a strange thing
to you
were happening
But
as
you have shared
in the
-
of Christ
sufferings
rejoice
so that
also
in
the
revelation
of the
glory
of Him
you may rejoice
exulting
If
you are insulted
in
[the] name
of Christ
[you are] blessed
because
the
-
of glory
and
-
-
of God
Spirit
upon
you
rests
Not
for
any
of you
let suffer
as
a murderer
or
a thief
or
an evildoer
or
as
a troublesome meddler
if
however
as
a Christian
not
let him be ashamed
let him glorify
however
-
God
in
the
name
this
For [it is]
the
time [for]
-
to have begun
the
judgment
from
the
house
-
of God
if
now
first
from
us
what [will be]
the
outcome
of those
disobeying
the
-
of God
gospel
And
If
the
righteous [one]
with difficulty
is saved
the
ungodly
and
sinner
where
will appear
Therefore
also
those
suffering
according to
the
will
-
of God
to [the] faithful
Creator
let them commit
the
souls
of them
in
well doing
Elders
-
among
you
I exhort
-
a fellow elder
and
witness
of the
-
of Christ
sufferings
who [am]
also
of the
being about
to be revealed
glory
partaker
Shepherd
the
among
you
flock
-
of God
not
under compulsion
but
willingly
according to
God
and not
for base gain
but
eagerly
not
as
exercising lordship over
-
those in your charge
but
examples
being
to the
flock
And
having been revealed
the
Chief Shepherd
you will receive
the
unfading
-
of glory
crown
Likewise
younger [ones]
be subject
to [your] elders
All
now
one to another
-
humility
gird on
because
-
God
[the] proud
opposes
to [the] humble
however
He gives
grace
Be humbled
therefore
under
the
mighty
hand
-
of God
so that
you
He may exalt
in
[due] time
all
the
anxiety
of you
having cast
upon
Him
because
with Him
there is care
about
you
Be sober-minded
watch
The
adversary
of You
[the] devil
as
a lion
roaring
prowls about
seeking
whom
to devour
whom
you should resist
firm
in the
faith
knowing
the
same
-
sufferings
-
throughout
the
world
in your
brotherhood
to be accomplished
The
now
God
of all
grace
the [one]
having called
you
to
the
eternal
of Him
glory
in
Christ
a little while
[of you] having suffered
He Himself
will perfect
will confirm
will strengthen
[and] will establish [you]
To Him [be]
the
power
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
Through
Silvanus
to you
the
faithful
brother
as
I regard [him]
through
few [words]
I have written
exhorting
and
testifying
this
to be
[the] true
grace
-
of God
in
which
you stand
Greets
you
she
in
Babylon
elected with [you]
and
Mark
the
son
of me
Greet
one another
with
a kiss
of love
Peace [be]
to you
all
who [are]
in
Christ
Simon
Peter
a servant
and
apostle
of Jesus
Christ
To those
equally precious
with ours
having obtained
a faith
through
[the] righteousness
of the
God
of us
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
Grace
to you
and
peace
be multiplied
in
[the] knowledge
-
of God
and
of Jesus
the
Lord
of us
Accordingly
-
all things
to us
the
divine
power
of Him
-
toward
life
and
godliness
has given
through
the
knowledge
of the [One]
having called
us
[by His] own
glory
and
excellence
through
which
the
precious
and
magnificent
to us
promises
He has given
so that
through
these
you might become
of [the] divine
partakers
nature
having escaped
the
in
the
world
in
desire
decay
And
very [reason]
for this
now
earnestness
all
having brought in
supplement
into
the
faith
of you
-
virtue
into
and
-
virtue
-
knowledge

These things
for
in you
being
and
abounding
neither
idle
nor
unfruitful
make [you]
as to
the
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
knowledge
In whomever
for
not
are present
these things
blind
he is
being short sighted
forgetfulness
having received
of the
purification
the
former
of him
sins
Therefore
rather
brothers
be diligent
sure
your
-
calling
and
election
to make
these things
for
practicing
never
not
shall you stumble
at any time
In this way
for
richly
will be supplied
to you
the
entrance
into
the
eternal
kingdom
of the
Lord
of us
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
Therefore
I will be ready
always
you
to remind
concerning
these things
though
knowing [them]
and
having been strengthened
in
the
being present [in you]
truth
Right
now
I esteem it
as
long as
I am
in
this
-
tabernacle
to stir up
you
by
putting [you] in remembrance
knowing
that
impending
is
the
putting off
of the
tabernacle
of me
as
also
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
has made clear
to me
I will be diligent
now
also
at every time
to have
for you
after
-
my
departure
-
these things
a lasting remembrance
to make
Not
for
cleverly devised
fables
having followed out
we have made known
to you
the
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
power
and
coming
but
eyewitnesses
having been
-
of His
majesty
Having received
for
from
God
[the] Father
honor
and
glory
a voice
was brought
to Him
such as follows
by
the
Majestic
Glory
The
Son
of Me
-
beloved
of Me
this
is
in
whom
I
have found delight
And
this
-
voice
we
heard
from
heaven
having been brought
with
Him
being
in
the
holy
mountain
And
we have
more certain
the
prophetic
word
to which
well
you do
taking heed
as
to a lamp
shining
in
[a] dark
place
until
this
day
shall have dawned
and
[the] morning star
shall have arisen
in
the
hearts
of you
this
first
knowing
that
any
prophecy
of Scripture
of its own
interpretation
not
is
Not
for
by [the] will
of man
was brought
prophecy
at any time
but
by
[the] Spirit
Holy
being carried
spoke
from
God
men
There were
however
also
false prophets
among
the
people
as
also
among
you
there will be
false teachers
who
will stealthily introduce
heresies
destructive
even
the
having bought
them
Master
denying
bringing upon
themselves
swift
destruction
And
many
will follow after
their
-
sensuality
through
whom
the
way
of the
truth
will be maligned
And
through
covetousness
with fabricated
words
you
they will exploit
for whom
the
judgment
of long ago
not
is idle
and
the
destruction
of them
not
slumbers
If
for
-
God
[the] angels
having sinned
not
spared
but
in chains
of gloomy darkness
having cast [them] down to Tartarus
delivered [them]
for
judgment
being kept
and
[the] ancient
world
not
He spared
but
one of eight
Noah
of righteousness
a herald
preserved
[the] flood upon
[the] world
of [the] ungodly
having brought in
and
[the] cities
of Sodom
and
Gomorrah
having reduced to ashes
to destruction
He condemned [them]
an example
of what is coming on
the ungodly
having set
and
righteous
Lot
being distressed
by
the
of the
lawless
in
sensuality
conduct
He rescued
through seeing
for
and
hearing
that
righteous [man]
dwelling
among
them
day
after
day
in [his] soul
righteous
with [their] lawless
deeds
was tormented
[then] knows
[the] Lord
[the] devout
out of
temptation
to deliver
[the] unrighteous
then
unto
[the] day
of judgment
being punished
to keep
especially
then
those
after
[the] flesh
in
[the] passion
of defilement
walking
and
authority
despising
Bold
self-willed
glorious ones
not
they tremble
blaspheming
whereas
angels
in strength
and
power
greater
being
not
do bring
against
them
before
[the] Lord
a reviling
judgment
These
however
like
irrational
animals
having been born
as creatures of instinct
for
capture
and
destruction
in
what
they are ignorant of
blaspheming
in
the
destruction
of them
also
will be destroyed
suffering wrong
[as the] wage
of unrighteousness
[as] pleasure
esteeming
-
in
daytime
carousal
blots
and
blemishes
reveling
in
the
deceptions
of them
feasting with
you
eyes
having
full
of adultery
and
unceasing
from sin
enticing
souls
unestablished
a heart
having been exercised
in craving
having
of a curse
children
Having left
[the] straight
way
they have gone astray
having followed
in the
way
-
of Balaam
-
[son] of Bosor
who
[the] wage
of unrighteousness
loved
reproof
however
he had
for his own
transgression
[by] a donkey
mute
in
a manâs
voice
having spoken
it restrained
the
of the
prophet
madness
These
are
springs
without water
and
mists
by
storm
being driven
for whom
-
gloom
-
of darkness
has been reserved
Arrogant
for
of vanity
speaking words
they entice
with
[the] passions
of [the] flesh
to sensuality
those
barely
escaping
from those
in
error
living
freedom
them
promising
themselves
slaves
being
-
of corruption
By what
for
anyone
has been subdued
by that
he is enslaved
If
for
having escaped
the
pollutions
of the
world
through
[the] knowledge
of the
Lord
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
in these
now
again
having been entangled
they are subdued
has become
to them
the
last [state]
worse
than the
first
Better
for
it would have been
for them
not
to have known
the
way
-
of righteousness
than
having known [it]
to have turned
from
the
having been delivered
to them
holy
commandment
Has happened
to them
the thing
of the
true
proverb
A dog
having returned
to
[its]
own
vomit
and
A sow
having washed
to [her]
rolling place
in [the] mire
This
now
beloved
[is the] second
to you
I am writing
letter
in
which
I am stirring up
of you
in
putting [you] in remembrance
-
pure
mind
to remember
the
having been spoken beforehand
words
by
the
holy
prophets
and
of the
-
apostles
through your
commandment
of the
Lord
and
Savior
this
first
knowing
that
will come
in
[the] last
of the
days
with
scoffing
scoffers
according to
-
own
evil desires
of them
following
and
saying
Where
is
the
promise
of the
coming
of Him
From
[the time] that
for
the
fathers
fell asleep
all things
as they were
continue
from
[the] beginning
of creation
It is concealed from
indeed
them
this
willingly
that
heavens
existed
long ago
and
[the] earth
out of
water
and
through
water
having been composed
by the
-
of God
word
through
which
the
at that time
world
with water
having been deluged
perished
-
But
now
the heavens
and
the
earth
by the
same
word
having been stored up
exist
for fire
being kept
unto
[the] day
of judgment
and
destruction
-
of ungodly
men
[This] one
however
thing
not
let be hidden from
you
beloved
that
one
day
with [the]
Lord [is]
like
a thousand
years
and
a thousand
years
like
day
one
Not
does delay
the Lord
the
promise
as
some
slowness
esteem
but
is patient
toward
you
not
willing
[for] any
to perish
but
all
to
repentance
to come
Will come
however
[the] day
of [the] Lord
like
a thief
in
which
the
heavens
with a roar
will pass away
elements
then
burning with heat
will be dissolved
and
[the] earth
and
the
in
it
works
will be found
These things
in this way
all
being dissolved
what kind
ought
to be
you
In
holy
conduct
and
godliness
expecting
and
hastening
the
coming
of the
-
of God
day
by reason of
which
[the] heavens
being set on fire
will be dissolved
and
[the] elements
burning with heat
are melting
New
however
heavens
and
earth
a new
according to
the
promise
of Him
we are awaiting
in
which
righteousness
dwells
Therefore
beloved
these things
expecting
be diligent
without spot
and
without blemish
by Him
to be found
in
peace
And
the
of the
Lord
of us
patience
[as] salvation
esteem
just as
also
-
beloved
of us
brother
Paul
according to
the
having been given
to him
wisdom
wrote
to you
as
also
in
all
letters
speaking
in
them
concerning
these things
among
which
are
difficult to be understood
some things
which
the
ignorant
and
unestablished
distort
as
also
the
other
Scriptures
to
the
own
of them
destruction
You
therefore
beloved
knowing [this] beforehand
beware
that
not
by the
of the
lawless
error
having been led away
you should fall from
the
own
steadfastness
Grow
however
in
grace
and
in knowledge
of the
Lord
of us
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
To Him [be]
the
glory
both
now
and
to
[the] day
of eternity
That which
was
from
[the] beginning
that which
we have heard
that which
we have seen
with the
eyes
of us
that which
we have gazed upon
and
the
hands
of us
have handled
concerning
the
Word
-
of life
and
the
life
was made manifest
and
we have seen
and
bear witness
and
we proclaim
to you
the
life
-
eternal
which
was
with
the
Father
and
was revealed
to us
that which
we have seen
and
have heard
we proclaim
also
to you
so that
also
you
fellowship
may have
with
us
Indeed
the
fellowship
now
-
of us
[is] with
the
Father
and
with
the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
And
these things
write
we
so that
the
joy
of us
might be
complete
And
is
this
the
message
that
we have heard
from
Him
and
we preach
to you
that
-
God
light
is
and
darkness
in
Him
not
is
none
If
we should say
that
fellowship
we have
with
Him
and yet
in
the
darkness
should walk
we lie
and
not
do practice
the
truth
If
however
in
the
light
we should walk
as
He
is
in
the
light
fellowship
we have
with
one another
and
the
blood
of Jesus
the
Son
of Him
cleanses
us
from
all
sin
If
we should say
that
sin
not
we have
ourselves
we deceive
and
the
truth
not
is
in
us
If
we should confess
the
sins
of us
faithful
He is
and
just
that
He may forgive
us
[our]
sins
and
might cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
If
we should say
that
not
we have sinned
a liar
we make
Him
and
the
word
of Him
not
is
in
us
Little children
of me
these things
I am writing
to you
so that
not
you might sin
And
if
anyone
should sin
an advocate
we have
with
the
Father
Jesus
Christ
[the] Righteous [One]
And
He
[the] propitiation
is
for
the
sins
of us
not
for
the
of ours
and
only
but
also
for
all
the
world
And
by
this
we know
that
we have come to know
Him
if
the
commandments
of Him
we should keep
The [one]
saying
-
I have known
Him
and
the
commandments
of Him
not
keeping
a liar
he is
and
in
him
the
truth
not
is
Whoever
however
-
may keep
His
-
word
truly
in
him
the
love
-
of God
has been perfected
By
this
we know
that
in
Him
we are
The [one]
claiming
in
Him
to abide
ought
just as
that
walk
also
He
in the same way
walked
Beloved
not
a commandment
new
I am writing
to you
but
a commandment
old
which
you have had
from
[the] beginning
The
commandment
-
old
is
the
word
that
you have heard
Again
a commandment
new
I am writing
to you
which
is
true
in
Him
and
in
you
because
the
darkness
is passing away
and
the
light
-
true
already
shines
The [one]
claiming
in
the
light
to be
and
the
brother
of him
hating
in
the
darkness
is
even until
now
The [one]
loving
the
brother
of him
in
the
light
abides
and
cause for stumbling
in
him
not
there is
The [one]
however
hating
the
brother
of him
in
the
darkness
is
and
in
the
darkness
walks
and
not
does he know
where
he is going
because
the
darkness
has blinded
the
eyes
of him
I am writing
to you
little children
because
have been forgiven
your
-
sins
for the sake of
the
name
of Him
I am writing
to you
fathers
because
you have known
Him who [is]
from
[the] beginning
I am writing
to you
young men
because
you have overcome
the
evil [one]
I have written
to you
little children
because
you know
the
Father
I have written
to you
fathers
because
you know
Him who [is]
from
[the] beginning
I have written
to you
young men
because
strong
you are
and
the
word
-
of God
in
you
abides
and
you have overcome
the
evil [one]
Not
love
the
world
nor
the things
in
the
world
If
anyone
should love
the
world
not
is
the
love
of the
Father
in
him
because
all
that [is]
in
the
world
the
desire
of the
flesh
and
the
desire
of the
eyes
and
the
vaunting
of
life
not
is
from
the
Father
but
from
the
world
is
And
the
world
is passing away
and
the
desire
of it
the [one]
however
doing
the
will
-
of God
abides
to
the
age
Little children
[the] last
hour
it is
and
as
you have heard
that
antichrist
is coming
even
now
antichrists
many
have arisen
whereby
we know
that
[the] last
hour
it is
From among
us
they went out
but
not
they were
of
us
if
for
of
us
they had been
they would have remained
-
with
us
But
[it is] so that
it might be made manifest
that
not
they are
all
of
us
And
you
[the] anointing
have
from
the
Holy [One]
and
know you
all
Not
I have written
to you
because
not
you know
the
truth
but
because
you know
it
and
because
any
lie
of
the
truth
not
is
Who
is
the
liar
if
not
the [one]
denying
that
Jesus
not
is
the
Christ
This
is
the
antichrist
the [one]
denying
the
Father
and
the
Son
Everyone
-
denying
the
Son
neither
the
Father
has he
The [one]
confessing
the
Son
also
the
Father
has
You
what
you have heard
from
[the] beginning
in
you
let it abide
If
in
you
should abide
what
from
[the] beginning
you have heard
also
you
in
the
Son
and
in
the
Father
will abide
And
this
is
the
promise
that
He
promised
us
-
life
-
eternal
These things
I have written
to you
concerning
those
leading astray
you
And
you
the
anointing
that
you received
from
Him
abides
in
you
and
not
need
you have
that
anyone
should teach
you
But
just as
the
same
anointing
teaches
you
concerning
all things
and
true
is
and
not
is
a lie
and
just as
it has taught
you
you shall abide
in
Him
And
now
little children
abide
in
Him
so that
when
He appears
we might have
boldness
and
not
be ashamed
before
Him
at
the
coming
of Him
If
you know
that
righteous
He is
you know
that
also
everyone
-
practicing
-
righteousness
of
Him
has been begotten
Behold
what
love
has given
to us
the
Father
that
children
of God
we should be called
and
we are
Because of
this
the
world
not
knows
us
because
not
it knew
Him
Beloved
now
children
of God
are we
and
not yet
has been revealed
what
we will be
We know
that
when
He appears
like
Him
we will be
for
we will see
Him
as
He is
And
everyone
-
having
the
hope
this
in
Him
purifies
himself
just as
He
pure
is
Everyone
-
committing
-
sin
also
-
lawlessness
commits
and
-
sin
is
-
lawlessness
And
you know
that
He
appeared
so that
-
sins
He might take away
and
sin
in
Him
not
there is
Anyone
-
in
Him
abiding
not
sins
anyone
-
sinning
not
has seen
Him
nor
has he known
Him
Little children
no one
let lead astray
you
the [one]
practicing
-
righteousness
righteous
is
just as
He
righteous
is
The [one]
practicing
-
sin
of
the
devil
is
because
from
[the] beginning
the
devil
has been sinning
For
this [reason]
was revealed
the
Son
-
of God
so that
He might destroy
the
works
of the
devil
Anyone
-
having been born
of
-
God
sin
not
practices
because
seed
of Him
in
him
abides
and
not
he is able
to continue sinning
because
of
-
God
he has been born
Through
this
manifest
are
the
children
-
of God
and
the
children
of the
devil
Anyone
-
not
practicing
righteousness
not
is
of
-
God
and also
the [one]
not
loving
the
brother
of him
For
this
is
the
message
that
you have heard
from
[the] beginning
that
we should love
one another
not
as
Cain
[who] of
the
evil [one]
was
and
slew
the
brother
of him
And
because of
what
he slayed
him
Because
the
works
of him
evil
were
those
however
of the
brother
of him
righteous
not
be surprised
brothers
if
hates
you
the
world
We
know
that
we have passed
from
-
death
to
-
life
because
we love
[our]
brothers
The [one]
not
loving
abides
in
-
death
Everyone
-
hating
the
brother
of him
a murderer
is
and
you know
that
any
murderer
not
has
life
eternal
in
him
abiding
By
this
we have known
-
love
because
He
for
us
the
life
of Him
laid down
and
we
ought
for
[our]
brothers
[our]
lives
to lay down
Whoever
now
-
might have
the
goods
of the
world
and
might see
the
brother
of him
need
having
and
might close up
the
heart
of him
from
him
how
the
love
-
of God
abides
in
him
Little children
not
we should love
in word
nor
in
tongue
but
in
action
and
in truth
by
this
we will know
that
of
the
truth
we are
and
before
Him
we will assure
the
heart
of us
that
if
should condemn [us]
our
-
heart
that
greater than
is
-
God
the
heart
of us
and
He knows
all things
Beloved
if
the
heart
not
should condemn [us]
confidence
we have
toward
-
God
and
whatever
if
we might ask
we receive
from
Him
because
the
commandments
of Him
we keep
and
the things
pleasing
before
Him
we do
And
this
is
the
commandment
of Him
that
we should believe
in the
name
the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
and
we should love
one another
just as
He gave
[the] commandment
to us
And
the [one]
keeping
the
commandments
of Him
in
Him
abides
and
He
in
him
And
by
this
we know
that
He abides
in
us
by
the
Spirit
whom
to us
He has given
Beloved
not
every
spirit
believe
but
test
the
spirits
whether
of
-
God
they are
because
many
false prophets
have gone out
into
the
world
By
this
you know
the
Spirit
-
of God
Every
spirit
that
confesses
Jesus
Christ
in
[the] flesh
having come
of
-
God
is
and
any
spirit
that
not
confesses
-
Jesus
from
-
God
not
is
And
this
is
that
of the
antichrist
which
you heard
that
is coming
and
now
in
the
world
is
already
You
from
-
God
are
little children
and
have overcome
them
because
greater
is
the [One]
in
you
than
the [one]
in
the
world
They
of
the
world
are
because of
this
from out
of the
world
they speak
and
the
world
them
listens to
We
of
-
God
are
The [one]
knowing
-
God
listens to
us
He who
not
is
from
-
God
not
listens to
us
By
this
we know
the
Spirit
-
of truth
and
the
spirit
-
of falsehood
Beloved
we should love
one another
because
-
love
from
-
God
is
and
everyone
-
loving
from
-
God
has been born
and
knows
-
God
The [one]
not
loving
not
has known
-
God
because
-
God
love
is
In
this
has been revealed
the
love
-
of God
among
us
that
the
Son
of Him
the
one and only
has sent
-
God
into
the
world
so that
we might live
through
Him
In
this
is
-
love
not
that
we
loved
-
God
but
that
He
loved
us
and
sent
the
Son
of Him
[as] a propitiation
for
the
sins
of us
Beloved
if
so
-
God
loved
us
also
we
ought
one another
to love
God
no one
at any time
has seen
if
we should love
one another
-
God
in
us
abides
and
the
love
of Him
having been perfected
in
us
is
By
this
we know
that
in
Him
we abide
and
He
in
us
because
from out
the
Spirit
of Him
He has given
to us
And
we
have seen
and
testify
that
the
Father
has sent
the
Son [as]
Savior
of the
world
Whoever
if
shall confess
that
Jesus
is
the
Son
-
of God
-
God
in
him
abides
and
he
in
-
God
And
we
have come to know
and
have come to believe
the
love
that
has
-
God
as to
us
-
God
love
is
and
the [one]
abiding
in
-
love
in
-
God
abides
and
-
God
in
him
abides
In
this
has been perfected
-
love
with
us
so that
confidence
we may have
in
the
day
-
of judgment
that
just as
He
is
also
we
are
in
the
world
this
Fear
no
there is
in
-
love
but
-
perfect
love
out
casts
-
fear
because
the
fear
punishment
has
the [one]
now
fearing
not
has been perfected
in
-
love
We
love
because
He
first
loved
us
If
anyone
should say
-
I love
-
God
and
the
brother
of him
should hate
a liar
he is
The [one]
for
not
loving
the
brother
of him
whom
he has seen
-
God
whom
not
he has seen
not
is he able
to love
And
this
the
commandment
we have
from
Him
that
the [one]
loving
-
God
should love
also
the
brother
of him
Everyone
-
believing
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
of
-
God
has been born
and
everyone
-
loving
the [One]
having begotten [Him]
loves
the [one]
having been begotten
from
Him
By
this
we know
that
we love
the
children
-
of God
when
-
God
we love
and
the
commandments
of Him
keep
This
for
is
the
love
-
of God
that
the
commandments
of Him
we should keep
and
the
commandments
of Him
burdensome
not
are
For
everyone
-
having been born
of
-
God
overcomes
the
world
and
this
is
the
victory
-
having overcome
the
world
the
faith
of us
Who
is
the [one]
overcoming
the
world
if
not
the [one]
believing
that
Jesus
is
the
Son
-
of God
This
is
the [One]
having come
by
water
and
blood
Jesus
Christ
not
by
-
water
only
but
by
-
water
and
by
-
blood
And
the
Spirit
is
the [One]
testifying
because
the
Spirit
is
the
truth
For
three
there are
-
bearing testimony
the
Spirit
and
the
water
and
the
blood
and
these
three
in
-
one
are
If
the
testimony
-
of men
we receive
the
testimony
-
of God
greater
is
For
this
is
the
testimony
-
of God
that
He has testified
concerning
the
Son
of Him
The [one]
believing
in
the
Son
-
of God
has
the
testimony
in
himself
The [one]
not
believing
-
God
a liar
has made
Him
because
not
he has believed
in
the
testimony
that
has testified
-
God
concerning
the
Son
Him
And
this
is
the
testimony
that
life
eternal
has given
-
God
to us
and
this
the
life
in
the
Son
His
is
The [one]
having
the
Son
has
-
life
the [one]
not
having
the
Son
-
of God
-
life
not
has
These things
have I written
to you
so that
you may know
that
life
you have
eternal
to those
believing
in
the
name
of the
Son
-
of God
And
this
is
the
confidence
that
we have
toward
Him
that
if
anything
we might ask
according to
the
will
of Him
He hears
us
And
if
we know
that
He hears
us
whatever
if
we might ask
we know
that
we have
the
requests
that
we have asked
from
Him
If
anyone
should see
the
brother
of him
sinning
a sin
not
unto
death
he shall ask
and
He will give
him
life
to those
sinning
not
unto
death
There is
a sin
unto
death
not
concerning
that
do I say
that
he should implore
All
unrighteousness
sin
is
and
there is
sin
not
unto
death
We know
that
everyone
-
having been born
of
-
God
not
continues to sin
but
the [One]
having been begotten
of
-
God
protects
him
and
the
evil [one]
not
does touch
him
We know
that
of
-
God
we are
and
the
world
whole
in
the
evil [one]
lies
We know
now
that
the
Son
-
of God
is come
and
has given
us
understanding
so that
we may know
Him who [is]
true
and
we are
in
Him who [is]
true
in
the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
He
is
the
true
God
and
life
eternal

just as
commandment
we received
from
the
Father
And
now
I implore
you
lady
not
as
a commandment
I am writing
to you
new
but
that which
we have had
from
[the] beginning
that
we should love
one another
And
this
is
-
love
that
we should walk
according to
the
commandments
of Him
This
the
commandment
is
just as
you have heard
from
[the] beginning
so that
in
it
you should walk
For
many
deceivers
have entered
into
the
world
those
not
confessing
Jesus
Christ
coming
in
flesh
This
is
the
deceiver
and
the
antichrist
Watch

faithfully
you are doing

and
they are
strangers

love
before
[the] church
whom
well
you will do
having set forward
worthily
-
of God
On behalf
for
of the
name
they went forth
nothing
accepting
from
the
Gentiles
We
therefore
ought
to receive
-
such [men]
so that
fellow workers
we may be
in the
truth
I have written
something
to the
church
but
the [one]
loving to be first
among them
Diotrephes
not
welcomes
us
Because of
this
if
I might come
I will bring to remembrance
of him
the
works
which
he is doing
with words
evil
prating against
us
and
not
being satisfied
with
these
neither
himself
he receives
the
brothers
and
those
purposing
he forbids
and
from
the
church
he casts [them] out
Beloved
not
do imitate

To remind
now
you
I want
having known
at one time
all this
that
Jesus

out of

of Egypt
having saved

afterward
those
not
having believed
He destroyed
[The] angels
both

not
having kept
[own]
their
domain
but
having left
the
own
dwelling
unto
[the] judgment
of [the] great
day
in chains
eternal
under
darkness
He keeps
just as
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
the

in like
manner
with them
having indulged in sexual immorality
and
having gone
after

But
Michael
the
archangel
when
with the
devil
disputing
he was reasoning
about
-
Mosesâ
body
not
did dare
a judgment
to bring against [him]
blasphemous
but
said
Rebuke
you
[the] Lord
These
however
whatever things
indeed
not
they have seen
they speak evil of
whatever things
then
naturally
as
the
irrational
animals
they understand
in
these things
they corrupt themselves
Woe
to them
because
in the
way
-
of Cain
they went
and
to the
error
-
of Balaam
for reward
they rushed
and
in the
rebellion
-
of Korah
they perished
These
are
the ones

of you

I
John
the
brother
of you
and
fellow-partaker
in
the
tribulation
and
kingdom
and
endurance
in
Jesus
was
in
the
island
-
called
Patmos
on account of
the
word
-
of God
and
the
testimony
of Jesus
I was
in
[the] Spirit
on
the
Lordâs
day
and
I heard
behind
me
a voice
loud
like that
of a trumpet
saying
What
you see
write
in
a book
and
send
to the
seven
churches
to
Ephesus
and
to
Smyrna
and
to
Pergamum
and
to
Thyatira
and
to
Sardis
and
to
Philadelphia
and
to
Laodicea
And
I turned
to see
the
voice
that
was speaking
with
me
And
having turned
I saw
seven
lampstands
golden
and
in
[the] midst
of the
lampstands
[One] like
[the] Son
of Man
having been clothed
to the feet
and
having been girded about
at
the
breasts
with a sash
golden
-
And
the head
of Him
and
the
hairs
[are] white
as if
wool
white
as
snow
and
the
eyes
of Him
[are] like
a flame
of fire
and
the
feet
of Him
[are] like
fine bronze
as
in
a furnace
having been refined
and
the
voice
of Him
[is] like
[the] voice
of waters
many
and
He is holding
in
the
right
hand
of Him
stars
seven
and
out of
the
mouth
of Him
a sword
two-edged
sharp
is going forth
and
the
face
of Him
[is] like
the
sun
shining
in
the
full strength
of it
And
when
I saw
Him
I fell
at
the
feet
of Him
as though
dead
And
He placed
the
right hand
of Him
upon
me
saying
Not
fear
I
am
the
First
and
the
Last
and
the
Living [One]
and
I was
dead
and
behold
living
I am
to
the
ages
of the
ages
and
I have
the
keys
of
Death
and
of
Hades
Write
therefore
the things that
you have seen
and
the things that
are
and
the things that
are about
to take place
after
these
the
mystery
of the
seven
stars
which
you saw
on
the
right hand
of Me
and
the
seven
lampstands
-
golden
The
seven
stars
[the] angels
of the
seven
churches
are
and

lampstands

These things

the [One]
holding
the
seven
stars
in
the
right hand
of Him
-
walking
in
[the] midst
of the
seven
lampstands
-
golden
I know
the
works
of you
and
the
labor
and
-
endurance
of you
and
that
not
you are able
to tolerate
evil [ones]
And
you have tested
those
claiming
to be
apostles
and
not
are
and
you have found
them
false
And
perseverance
you have
and
have endured
for the sake of
the
name
of Me
and
not
have grown weary
But
I have
against
you
that
the
love
of you
-
first
you have abandoned
Remember
therefore
from where
you have fallen
and
repent
and
the
first
works
do
If
however
not
I am coming
to you
and
I will remove
the
lampstand
of you
out of
the
place
of it
if
not
you should repent
But
this
you have
that
you hate
the
works
of the
Nicolaitans
which
I also
hate
The [one]

what
the
Spirit
says

To the [one]

I will give
to him
to eat

These things

the
First

the
Last
who
became
dead
and
came to life
I know
your

tribulation

poverty
but
rich
you are
and
the
slander
of
those
claiming
Jews
to be
themselves
and
not
are
but
a synagogue
-
of Satan
Not
fear
what
you are about
to suffer
Behold
is about
to cast
the
devil
[some] of
you
into
prison
so that
you might be tested
and
you shall have
tribulation
days
ten
Be
faithful
unto
death
and
I will give
to you
the
crown

of life

to
[the] messenger
of the
in
Pergamum
church

These things
says
the [One]
having
the
sword
-
two-edged
-
sharp
I know
where
you dwell
where
the
throne
-
of Satan [is]
and
you hold fast to
the
name
of Me
and
not
you have denied
the
faith
of Me
even
in
the
days
of Antipas
the
witness
of Me
the
faithful [one]
of Me
who
was killed
among
you
where
-
Satan
dwells
But
I have
against
you
a few things
because
you have
[some] there
holding
the
teaching
of Balaam
who
would teach
-
Balak
to cast
a snare
before
the
sons
of Israel
to eat
things sacrificed to idols
and
to commit sexual immorality
So
have
also
you
[some] holding
the
teaching
of the
Nicolaitans
likewise
Repent
therefore
If
however
not
I am coming
to you
quickly
and
I will make war
against
them
with
the
sword
of the
mouth
of Me
The [one]

Spirit
says

the
manna

stone
white

the
stone
a name
new
having been written
which
no one
has known

not
the [one]
receiving [it]
And
to
[the] messenger
of the
in
Thyatira
church
write
These things
says
the
Son
-
of God
the [One]
having
the
eyes
of Him
like
a flame
of fire
and
the
feet
of Him
like
burnished bronze
I know
your

works
and
-
love
and
-
faith
and
-
service
and
the
perseverance
of you
and
the
works
of you
the
latter
[are] greater
than the
first
But
I have
against
you
that
you tolerate
the
woman
Jezebel
the [one]
calling
herself
a prophetess
and
teaching
and
misleading
-
My
servants
to commit sexual immorality
and
to eat
things sacrificed to idols
And
I have given
her
time
that
she might repent
and
not
she is willing
to repent
of
the
sexual immorality
of her
Behold
I will cast
her
into
a sickbed
and
those
committing adultery
with
her
into
tribulation
great
if
not
they shall repent
of
the
deeds
of her
And
the
children
of her
I will kill
with
death
and
will know
all
the
churches
that
I
am
the [One]
searching
affections
and
hearts
and
I will give
of you
to each
according to
the
works
of you
To you
however
I say
to [the]
rest
of those
in
Thyatira
as many as
not
have
the
teaching
this
who
not
have known
the
depths
-
of Satan
as
they say
Not
I will cast
upon
you
any other
burden
But
to what
you have
hold fast
until
which [time]
-
I might come
And
the [one]
overcoming
and
-
keeping
until
[the] end
the
works
of Me
I will give
to him
authority
over
the
nations
and
he will shepherd
them
with
a rod
of iron
as
the
vessels [of]
the
potter
are broken in pieces
just as
I also
have received
from
the
Father
of Me
And
I will give
to him
the
star

watching
and
strengthen
the things
that remain
which
are about

I have found
your
works
having been completed
in the sight of
the
God
of Me
Remember
therefore
what
you have received
and
heard
and
keep [it]
and
repent
If
therefore
not
you shall watch
I will come
like
a thief
and
no
not
shall you know
at what
hour
I will come
upon
you
But
you have
a few
people
in
Sardis
who
not
have soiled
the
garments
of them
and
they will walk
with
Me
in
white
because
worthy
they are
The [one]
overcoming
thus
will be clothed
in
garments
white
And
no
not
will I blot out
the
name
of him
from
the
book

of life
and
I will confess
the
name

before
the
Father

deeds
Behold
I have set
before
you
a door
having been opened
which

it
because
little
you have
power

you have kept
My

Behold
I give
[those] from
the
synagogue

those
declaring
themselves
Jews

they lie
behold
I will cause
them
that
they will come
and
will worship
before
the
feet
of you
and
they shall know
that
I
have loved
you
Because
you have kept
the
word

you
will keep
out of

hour
of the
trial

being about
to come

inhabited world
whole
to try
those
dwelling
upon

earth
I am coming
quickly
Hold fast
to what
you have
so that
no one
may take
the
crown
of you
The [one]
overcoming
I will make
him
a pillar
in
the
temple
of the
God

out
no

anymore
And
I will write
upon
him

These things

Amen
the
Witness

faithful
and
true
the
Beginning
of the
creation

of God
I know
your
-
works
that
neither
cold
you are
nor
hot
I wish
cold
you would be
or
hot
So
because
lukewarm
you are
and
neither
hot
nor
cold
I am about
you
to spit
out of
the
mouth
of Me
For
you say
-
Rich
I am
and
I have grown rich
and
of nothing
need
I have
And
not
do you realize
that
you
are
-
wretched
and
miserable
and
poor
and
blind
and
naked
I counsel
you
to buy
from
Me
gold
having been refined
by
fire
so that
you may be rich
and
garments
white
so that
you may be clothed
and
not
might be made manifest
the
shame
of the
nakedness
of you
and
eye-salve
to anoint
the
eyes
of you
so that
you may see
I
as many as
if
might love

and
discipline
be zealous
therefore
and
repent
Behold
I stand
at
the
door
and
knock
If
anyone
should hear
the
voice
of Me
and
open
the
door
I will come in
to
him
and
will dine
with
him
and
he
with
Me
The [one]
overcoming
I will give
to him
to sit
with
Me
on
the
throne
of Me
as
I also
overcame
and
sat down
with
the
Father
of Me
on
the
throne
of Him
The [one]
having
an ear
let him hear
what
the
Spirit
says
to the
churches
After
these things
I looked
and
behold
a door
was standing open
in
-
heaven
and
the
voice
-
first
that
I heard
like
a trumpet
was speaking
with
me
saying
Come up
here
and
I will show
to you
what
it behooves
to take place
after
these things
Immediately
I was
in
[the] Spirit
and
behold
a throne
was set
in
-
heaven
and
upon
the
throne
[One] sitting
and
the [One]
sitting
[was] like
in appearance
stone
jasper
and
sardius
And
a rainbow
[was] around
the
throne
like
in appearance
an emerald
And
around
the
throne
thrones
[were] twenty
four
and
on
the
thrones
twenty
four
elders
sitting
having been clothed
in
garments
white
and
on
the
heads
of them
crowns
golden
And
out of
the
throne
come
flashes of lightning
and
voices
and
thunderings
And
[there were] seven
lamps
of fire
burning
before
the
throne
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
-
of God
And
before
the
throne
[was something] like
a sea
of glass
like
crystal
And
in
[the] midst
of the
throne
and
around
the
throne
[were] four
living creatures
being full
of eyes
in front
and
behind
And
the
living creature
-
first
[was] like
a lion
and
the
second
living creature
like
a calf
and
the
third
living creature
having
the
face
as
of a man
and
the
fourth
living creature
like
an eagle
flying
And
the
four
living creatures
one
for
one
of them
had
respectively
wings
six
all around
and
within
full
of eyes
and
rest
not
they have
day
and
night
saying
Holy
Holy
Holy
Lord
-
God
-
Almighty
the [One]
having been
and
the [One]
being
and
the [One]
coming
And
whenever
will give
the
living creatures
glory
and
honor
and
thanksgiving
to the [One]
sitting
upon
the
throne
the [One]
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages
will fall
the
twenty
four
elders
before
the [One]
sitting
upon
the
throne
and
they will worship
the [One]
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages
and
they will cast
the
crowns
of them
before
the
throne
saying
Worthy
are You
the
Lord
and
-
God
of us
to receive
-
glory
and
-
honor
and
-
power
for
You
created
-
all things
and
because of
the
will
of You
they existed
and
were created
And
I saw
on
the
right hand
of the [One]
sitting
upon
the
throne
a scroll
having been written
inside
and
on [the] back
having been sealed
with seals
seven
And
I saw
an angel
strong
proclaiming
in
a voice
loud
Who is
worthy
to open
the
scroll
and
to break
the
seals
of it
And
no one
was able
in
-
heaven
nor
upon
the
earth
nor
under
the
earth
to open
the
scroll
nor
to see
it
And
was weeping
loudly
because
no one
worthy
was found
to open
the
scroll
nor
to see
it
And
one
of
the
elders
says
to me
Not
do weep
Behold
has overcome
the
Lion
-
of
the
tribe
of Judah
the
root
of David
to open
the
scroll
and
the
seven
seals
of it
And
I saw
in
[the] midst
of the
throne
and
of the
four
living creatures
and
in
[the] midst
of the
elders
a Lamb
standing
as
having been slain
having
horns
seven
and
eyes
seven
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
-
of God
having been sent out
into
all
the
earth
And
He came
and
took [it]
out of
the
right hand
of the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
And
when
He had taken
the
scroll
the
four
living creatures
and
the
twenty
four
elders
fell down
before
the
Lamb
having
each
a harp
and
bowls
golden
being full
of incenses
which
are
the
prayers
of the
saints
And
they are singing
a song
new
saying
Worthy
are You
to take
the
scroll
and
to open
the
seals
of it
because
You were slain
and
You purchased
-
to God
by
the
blood
of You
out of
every
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
and
You have made
them
to the
God
of us
a kingdom
and
priests
and
they will reign
upon
the
earth
And
I looked
and
I heard
[the] voice
of angels
many
around
the
throne
and
of the
living creatures
and
of the
elders
and
was
the
number
of them
myriads
of myriads
and
thousands
of thousands
saying
in a voice
loud
Worthy
is
the
Lamb
-
having been slain
to receive
the
power
and
riches
and
wisdom
and
strength
and
honor
and
glory
and
blessing
And
every
creature
which
in
-
heaven
and
upon
the
earth
and
under
the
earth
and
on
the
sea
is
and
-
in
them
everything
I heard
saying
To the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
and
to the
Lamb
-
blessing
and
-
honor
and
-
glory
and
-
might
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
the
four
living creatures
kept saying
Amen
And
the
elders
fell down
and
worshiped
And
I watched
when
opened
the
Lamb
one
of
the
seven
seals
and
I heard
one
of
the
four
living creatures
saying
like
a voice
of thunder
Come
And
I looked
and
behold
a horse
white
and
the [one]
sitting
on
it
having
a bow
and
was given
to him
a crown
and
he went forth
overcoming
and
that
he might conquer
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
second
I heard
the
second
living creature
saying
Come
And
went forth
another
horse
bright red
and
to the [one]
sitting
on
it
was granted
to him
to take
the
peace
from
the
earth
and
that
one another
they will slay
and
was given
to him
a sword
great
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
third
I heard
the
third
living creature
saying
Come
And
I looked
and
behold
a horse
black
and
the [one]
sitting
on
it
having
a pair of scales
in
the
hand
of him
And
I heard
[something] like
a voice
in
[the] midst
of the
four
living creatures
saying
A choenix
of wheat
for a denarius
and
three
choenixes
of barley
for a denarius
and
the
oil
and
the
wine
not
you should injure
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
fourth
I heard
[the] voice
of the
fourth
living creature
saying
Come
And
I looked
and
behold
a horse
pale
and
the [one]
sitting
on
it
[the] name
of him [was]
-
Death
and
-
Hades
was following
with
him
and
was given
to them
authority
over
the
fourth
of the
earth
to kill
with
sword
and
with
famine
and
with
plague
and
by
the
beasts
of the
earth
And
when
He opened
the
fifth
seal
I saw
under
the
altar
the
souls
of those
having been slain
because of
the
word
-
of God
and
because of
the
testimony
which
they had upheld
And
they were crying
in a voice
loud
saying
Until
when
O
Lord
-
holy
and
true
not
do You judge
and
avenge
the
blood
of us
from
those
dwelling
upon
the
earth
And
were given
to them
each
robes
white
and
it was said
to them
that
they shall rest
yet
a time
little
until
would be fulfilled
also
the
fellow servants
of them
and
the
brothers
of them
those
being about
to be killed
as
also [had been]
they
And
I saw
when
He opened
the
seal
-
sixth
and
an earthquake
great
there was
and
the
sun
became
black
as
sackcloth
of hair
and
the
moon
whole
became
like
blood
and
the
stars
of
heaven
fell
to
the
earth
as
a fig tree
casts
the
unripe figs
of it
by
a wind
great
being shaken
And
-
heaven
departed
like
a scroll
being rolled up
and
every
mountain
and
island
out of
the
places
of them
were moved
And
the
kings
of the
earth
and
the
great ones
and
the
commanders
and
the
rich
and
the
powerful
and
every
slave
and
free
hid
themselves
in
the
caves
and
among
the
rocks
of the
mountains
And
they say
to the
mountains
and
to the
rocks
Fall
on
us
and
hide
us
from
[the] face
of the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
and
from
the
wrath
of the
Lamb
because
has come
the
day
-
great
of the
wrath
of Them
and
who
is able
to stand
After
these things
I saw
four
angels
standing
upon
the
four
corners
of the
earth
holding
the
four
winds
of the
earth
so that
no
would blow
wind
on
the
earth
nor
on
the
sea
nor
on
any
tree
And
I saw
another
angel
having ascended
from
[the] rising
of [the] sun
having
[the] seal
of God
[the] living
And
he cried
in a voice
loud
to the
four
angels
to whom
it had been given
to them
to harm
the
earth
and
the
sea
saying
Not
harm
the
earth
nor
the
sea
nor
the
trees
until
we shall have sealed
the
servants
of the
God
of us
on
the
foreheads
of them
And
I heard
the
number
of those
having been sealed
one hundred
forty
four
thousand
having been sealed
out of
every
tribe
of [the] sons
of Israel
Out of
[the] tribe
of Judah
twelve
thousand
having been sealed
out of
[the] tribe
of Reuben
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Gad
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Asher
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Naphtali
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Manasseh
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Simeon
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Levi
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Isaachar
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Zebulun
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Joseph
twelve
thousand
out of
[the] tribe
of Benjamin
twelve
thousand
having been sealed
After
these things
I looked
and
behold
a multitude
great
which
to number
it
no one
was able
out of
every
nation
and
tribes
and
peoples
and
tongues
standing
before
the
throne
and
before
the
Lamb
having been clothed with
robes
white
and
palm branches
in
the
hands
of them
And
they were crying out
in a voice
loud
saying
-
Salvation
to the
God
of us
the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
and
to the
Lamb
And
all
the
angels
stood
around
the
throne
and
the
elders
and
the
four
living creatures
and
they fell
before
the
throne
upon
the
faces
of them
and
worshiped
-
God
saying
Amen
-
Blessing
and
-
glory
and
-
wisdom
and
-
thanksgiving
and
-
honor
and
-
power
and
-
strength
to the
God
of us
to
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen
And
answered
one
of
the
elders
saying
to me
These
-
having been clothed with
the
robes
-
white
who
are they
and
from where
have they come
And
I said
to him
Lord
of me
you
know
And
he said
to me
These
are
the [ones]
coming
out of
the
tribulation
-
great
and
they have washed
the
robes
of them
and
made white
them
in
the
blood
of the
Lamb
Because of
this
They are
before
the
throne
-
of God
and
serve
Him
day
and
night
in
the
temple
of Him
and
the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
will tabernacle
over
them
Not
they will hunger
any more
neither
will they thirst
anymore
nor
at all
shall fall
upon
them
the
sun
nor
any
scorching heat
because
the
Lamb
-
in the
center
of the
throne
will shepherd
them
and
He will lead
them
to
living
fountains
of waters
and
will wipe away
-
God
every
tear
from
the
eyes
of them
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
seventh
there was
silence
in
-
heaven
for about
half an hour
And
I saw
the
seven
angels
who
before
-
God
stand
and
were given
to them
seven
trumpets
And
another
angel
came
and
stood
at
the
altar
having
a censer
golden
and
was given
to him
incense
much
that
he will offer [it]
with the
prayers
of the
saints
all
upon
the
altar
-
golden
-
before
the
throne
And
went up
the
smoke
of the
incense
with the
prayers
of the
saints
out of
[the] hand
of the
angel
before
-
God
And
took
the
angel
the
censer
and
filled
it
from
the
fire
of the
altar
and
cast [it]
to
the
earth
and
there were
thunders
and
rumblings
and
flashes of lightning
and
an earthquake
And
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
trumpets
prepared
themselves
that
they might sound the trumpets
And
the
first
sounded [his] trumpet
and
there was
hail
and
fire
having been mixed
with
blood
and
it was cast
upon
the
earth
And
a
third
of
the earth
was burned up
and
a
third
of the
trees
were burned up
and
all
[the] grass
green
was burned up
And
the
second
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
[something] like
a mountain
great
with fire
burning
was cast
into
the
sea
And
became
a
third
of the
sea
blood
and
died
a
third
of the
creatures
-
in
the
sea
-
having
life
and
a
third
of the
ships
were destroyed
And
the
third
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
fell
out of
-
heaven
a star
great
burning
like
a torch
And
it fell
upon
a
third
of the
rivers
and
upon
the
springs
of
waters
And
the
name
the
star
is called
-
Wormwood
And
became
a
third
of the
waters
into
wormwood
and
many
of the
men
died
from
the
waters
because
they were made bitter
And
the
fourth
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
was struck
a
third
of the
sun
and
a
third
of the
moon
and
a
third
of the
stars
so that
should be darkened
a
third
of them
and
the
day
not
should appear [for]
a
third
of it
and
the
night
likewise
And
I looked
and
I heard
one
eagle
flying
in
mid-heaven
saying
in a voice
loud
Woe
Woe
Woe
to those
dwelling
on
the
earth
because of
the
remaining
voices
of the
trumpet
of the
three
angels
-
being about
to sound [their] trumpets
And
the
fifth
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
I saw
a star
out of
-
heaven
having fallen
to
the
earth
and
was given
to it
the
key
of the
pit
of the
abyss
And
he opened
the
pit
of the
abyss
and
went up
smoke
out of
the
pit
like
[the] smoke
of a furnace
great
and
were darkened
the
sun
and
the
air
by
the
smoke
of the
pit
And
out of
the
smoke
came forth
locusts
unto
the
earth
and
was given
to them
power
like
have
power
the
scorpions
of the
earth
And
it was said
to them
that
not
they shall harm
the
grass
of the
earth
nor
any
green thing
nor
any
tree
if
not
the
men
-
not
having
the
seal
-
of God
on
the
foreheads
And
it was granted
to them
that
not
they should kill
them
but
that
they shall torment [them]
months
five
And
the
torment
of them
[was] like
torment
of a scorpion
when
it might strike
a man
And
in
the
days
those
will seek
-
men
-
death
and
not
no more
will find
it
and
they will long
to die
and
shall flee
-
death
from
them
And
the
appearance
of the
locusts [was]
like
horses
having been prepared
for
battle
and
upon
the
heads
of them
[were something] like
crowns
like
gold
and
the
faces
of them
like
[the] faces
of men
And
they had
hair
like
hair
of women
and
the
teeth
of them
like [those]
of lions
were
And
they had
breastplates
like
breastplates
of iron
and
the
sound
of the
wings
of them
[was] as
[the] sound
of chariots
of horses
many
rushing
into
battle
And
they have
tails
like
scorpions
and
stingers
and
in
the
tails
of them
[is] the
power
of them
to injure
-
men
for months
five
They have
over
them
a king
the
angel
of the
abyss
[The] name
of Him
in Hebrew
[is] Abaddon
and
in
the
Greek
[the] name
he has
Apollyon
-
Woe
the
first
has passed
Behold
are coming
still
two
woes
after
these things
And
the
sixth
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
I heard
voice
one
from
the
four
horns
of the
altar
-
golden
-
before
-
God
saying
to the
sixth
angel
the [one]
having
the
trumpet
Release
the
four
angels
those
having been bound
at
the
river
-
great
Euphrates
And
were released
the
four
angels
-
having been prepared
for
the
hour
and
day
and
month
and
year
so that
they might kill
a
third
-
of mankind
And
the
number
of the
armies
of the
cavalry [was]
twice ten thousand
ten thousands
I heard
the
number
of them
And
thus
I saw
the
horses
in
the
vision
and
those
sitting
on
them
having
breastplates
fiery
and
hyacinthine
and
brimstone
And
the
heads
of the
horses [were]
like
heads
of lions
and
out of
the
mouths
of them
proceed
fire
and
smoke
and
brimstone
By
-
three
plagues
these
was killed
a
third
of
mankind
by
the
fire
and
by the
smoke
and
by the
brimstone
-
proceeding
out of
the
mouths
of them
The
for
powers
of the
horses
in
the
mouths
of them
are
and
in
the
tails
of them
the
for
tails
of them
[are] like
serpents
having
heads
and
with
them
they injure


















































And
not
they repented
of
the
murders
of them
nor
of
the
sorceries
of them
nor
of
the
sexual immorality
of them
nor
of
the
thefts
of them
And
I saw
another
angel
mighty
coming down
out of
-
heaven
clothed with
a cloud
and
a
rainbow
upon
the
head
of him
and
the
face
of him
[was] like
the
sun
and
the
feet
of him
like
pillars
of fire
and
having
in
the
hand
of him
a little scroll
being open
And
he placed
the
foot
of him
-
right
upon
the
sea
the
and
left
upon
the
earth
And
he cried out
in a voice
loud
as
a lion
roars
And
when
he cried out
sounded
the
seven
thunders
the
of themselves
voice
And
when
had spoken
the
seven
thunders
I was about
to write
But
I heard
a voice
out of
-
heaven
saying
Seal
what
have spoken
the
seven
thunders
and
not
them
write
And
the
angel
whom
I saw
standing
on
the
sea
and
on
the
land
lifted up
the
hand
of him
the
right
to
-
heaven
and
he swore
by
the [One]
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages
who
created
-
heaven
and
the things
in
it
and
the
earth
and
the things
in
it
and
the
sea
and
the things
in
it
-
Delay
no longer
will there be
But
in
the
days
of the
voice
of the
seventh
angel
when
he is about
to sound [the] trumpet
then
would be completed
the
mystery
-
of God
as
proclaimed
the
of Himself
servants
the
prophets
And
the
voice
that
I heard
out of
-
heaven
again
was speaking
with
me
and
saying
Go
take
the
little scroll
-
having been opened
in
the
hand
of the
angel
-
standing
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
land
And
I went
to
the
angel
saying
to him
Give
me
the
little scroll
And
he says
to me
Take
and
eat
it
and
it will make bitter
your
-
stomach
but
in
the
mouth
of you
it will be
sweet
as
honey
And
I took
the
little scroll
out of
the
hand
of the
angel
and
I ate
it
and
it was
in
the
mouth
of me
as
honey
sweet
and
when
I had eaten
it
was made bitter
the
stomach
of me
And
they say
to me
It is necessary
for you
again
to prophesy
concerning
peoples
and
nations
and
tongues
and
kings
many
And
was given
to me
a measuring rod
like
a staff
saying
Rise
and
measure
the
temple
-
of God
and
the
altar
and
those
worshiping
in
it
And
the
courtyard
-
outside
the
temple
leave
out
and
not
it
measure
because
it has been given [up]
to the
nations
and
the
city
-
holy
they will trample upon
months
forty
two
And
I will grant
to the
two
witnesses
of me
and
they will prophesy
days
a thousand
two hundred
sixty
clothed in
sackcloth
These
are
the
two
olive trees
and
the
two
lampstands
-
before
the
Lord
of the
earth
standing
And
if
anyone
them
should desire
to harm
fire
goes out
of
the
mouth
of them
and
devours
the
enemies
of them
And
if
anyone
should desire
them
to harm
thus
it is necessary
for him
to be killed
These
have
the
power
to shut
the
sky
so that
no
rain
shall fall
in the
days
of the
prophecy
of them
and
power
they have
over
the
waters
to turn
them
into
blood
and
to strike
the
earth
with
every
plague
as often as
if
they might desire
And
when
they shall have completed
the
testimony
of them
the
beast
-
coming up
out of
the
abyss
will make
with
them
war
and
will overcome
them
and
will kill
them
And
the
body
of them
[will be] upon
the
street
of
city
the
great
which
is called
figuratively
Sodom
and
Egypt
where
also
the
Lord
of them
was crucified
And
gaze
[those] of
the
peoples
and
tribes
and
tongues
and
nations
upon the
bodies
of them
days
three
and
a half
and
the
bodies
of them
not
they will allow
to be put
into
a tomb
And
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
rejoice
over
them
and
make merry
and
gifts
will send
to one another
because
these
-
two
prophets
have tormented
those
dwelling
upon
the
earth
And
after
the
three
days
and
a half
[the] spirit
of life
from
-
God
entered
into
them
and
they stood
upon
the
feet
of them
and
fear
great
fell
upon
those
beholding
them
And
they heard
a voice
great
out of
-
heaven
saying
to them
Come up
here
And
they went up
to
-
heaven
in
the
cloud
and
beheld
them
the
enemies
of them
And
in
that
-
hour
there was
an earthquake
great
and
a
tenth
of the
city
fell
and
were killed
in
the
earthquake
names
of men
thousand
seven
And
the
rest
terrified
became
and
gave
glory
to the
God
of
heaven
The
woe
-
second
has passed
Behold
the
woe
-
third
is coming
quickly
And
the
seventh
angel
sounded [his] trumpet
and
there were
voices
great
in
-
heaven
saying
Has become
the
kingdom
of the
world
[that] of the
Lord
of us
and
of the
Christ
of Him
and
He will reign
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
the
twenty
four
elders
-
before
-
God
sitting
on
the
thrones
of them
fell
upon
the
faces
of them
and
worshiped
-
God
saying
We give thanks
to You
Lord
-
God
-
Almighty
the [One]
being
and
who
was
that
You have taken
the
power
of You
-
great
and
have begun to reign
And
the
nations
were enraged
and
came
the
wrath
of You
and
the
time
for the
dead
to be judged
and
to give
the
reward
to the
servants
of You
the
prophets
and
to the
saints
and
to those
fearing
the
name
of You
the
small
and
the
great
and
to destroy
those who
are destroying
the
earth
And
was opened
the
temple
-
of God
-
in
-
heaven
and
was seen
the
ark
of the
covenant
of Him
in
the
temple
of Him
And
there were
flashes of lightning
and
voices
and
thunders
and
an earthquake
and
hail
great
And
a sign
great
appeared
in
-
heaven
a woman
clothed with
the
sun
and
the
moon
under
the
feet
of her
and
on
the
head
of her
a crown
of stars
twelve
and
in
womb
having
And
she cries out
being in travail
and
being in pain
to bring forth
And
was seen
another
sign
in
-
heaven
and
behold
a dragon
red
great
having
heads
seven
and
horns
ten
and
upon
the
heads
of him
seven
royal crowns
And
the
tail
of him
drags
a
third
of the
stars
of
heaven
and
he cast
them
to
the
earth
And
the
dragon
stands
before
the
woman
-
being about
to bring forth
so that
when
she should bring forth
the
child
of her
he might devour
And
she brought forth
a son
male
who
is about
to rule
all
the
nations
with
a rod
of iron
and
was caught up
the
child
of her
to
-
God
and
to
the
throne
of Him
And
the
woman
fled
into
the
wilderness
where
she has
there
a place
having been prepared
by
-
God
so that
there
they should nourish
her
days
one thousand
two hundred
sixty
And
there was
war
in
-
heaven
-
Michael
and
the
angels
of him
-
warred
against
the
dragon
and
the
dragon
warred [back]
and
the
angels
of him
And
not
had he strength
nor
a place
was found
for them
any longer
in
-
heaven
And
was thrown [out]
the
dragon
-
great
the
serpent
-
ancient
who
is called
[the] devil
and
-
Satan
-
deceiving
the
inhabited [world]
whole
He was thrown down
to
the
earth
and
the
angels
of him
with
him
were thrown down
And
I heard
a voice
great
in
-
heaven
saying
Now
have come
the
salvation
and
the
power
and
the
kingdom
of the
God
of us
and
the
authority
the
Christ
of Him
because
has been thrown down
the
accuser
of the
brothers
of us
the [one]
accusing
them
before
the
God
of us
day
and
night
And
they
have overcome
him
by reason
of the
blood
of the
Lamb
and
by reason of
the
word
of the
testimony
of them
and
not
they have loved
the
life
of them
unto
death
Because of
this
rejoice
heavens
and
those
in
them
dwelling
Woe to
the
earth
and
the
sea
because
has come down
the
devil
to
you
having
fury
great
knowing
that
a short
time
he has
And
when
saw
the
dragon
that
he had been thrown down
to
the
earth
he pursued
the
woman
who
had brought forth
the
male [child]
And
were given
to the
woman
the
two
wings
of the
eagle
-
great
so that
she could fly
into
the
wilderness
into
the
place
of her
where
she is nourished
there
a time
and
times
and
half
a time
from
[the] face
of the
serpent
And
cast
the
serpent
out of
the
mouth
of him
after
the
woman
water
as
a river
so that
her
carried away by a flood
he might cause to be
And
helped
the
earth
the
woman
and
opened
the
earth
the
mouth
of it
and
swallowed up
the
river
which
had cast
the
dragon
out of
the
mouth
of him
And
was angry
the
dragon
with
the
woman
and
went
to make
war
with
the
rest
of the
children
of her
-
keeping
the
commandments
-
of God
and
holding
the
testimony
of Jesus
And
he stood
upon
the
sand
of the
sea
And
I saw
out of
the
sea
a beast
rising
having
horns
ten
and
heads
seven
and
on
the
horns
of it
ten
royal crowns
and
upon
the
heads
of it
names
of blasphemy
And
the
beast
that
I saw
was
like
a leopard
and
the
feet
of it
like
a bearâs
and
the
mouth
of it
like
[the] mouth
of a lion
And
gave
to it
the
dragon
the
power
of him
and
the
throne
of him
and
authority
great
And
one
of
the
heads
of it
[was] as
having been slain
to
death
And
the
wound
of
death
of it
was healed
and
marveled
all
the
earth
after
the
beast
And
they worshiped
the
dragon
who
had given
-
authority
to the
beast
and
they worshiped
the
beast
saying
Who
[is] like
the
beast
And
who
is able
to make war
against
it
And
was given
to it
a mouth
speaking
great things
and
blasphemy
and
was given
to it
authority
to act
months
forty
two
And
it opened
the
mouth
of it
unto
blasphemies
against
-
God
to blaspheme
the
name
of Him
and
the
tabernacle
of Him
those
in
-
heaven
dwelling
And
there was given
to it
to make
war
with
the
saints
and
to overcome
them
And
was given
to it
authority
over
every
tribe
and
people
and
tongue
and
nation
And
will worship
it
all
-
dwelling
on
the
earth
of whom
not
have been written
the
names
of them
in
the
book
-
of life
of the
Lamb
-
having been slain
from
[the] founding
of [the] world
If
anyone
has
an ear
let him hear
If
anyone [is to go]
into
captivity
into
captivity
he goes
If
anyone
with
[the] sword
is to be killed
it is necessary for
him
by
[the] sword
to be killed
Here
is
the
endurance
and
the
faith
of the
saints
And
I saw
another
beast
rising
out of
the
earth
and
it had
horns
two
like
a lamb
and
it was speaking
like
a dragon
And
the
authority
of the
first
beast
all
it exercises
on behalf
of it
and
causes
the
earth
and
those
in
it
dwelling
that
they will worship
the
beast
-
first
of whom
had been healed
the
wound
-
fatal
of it
And
it works
signs
great
so that
even
fire
it should cause
out of
-
heaven
to come down
to
the
earth
in the presence
-
of men
And
it deceives
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
by reason of
the
signs
that
were given
to it
to perform
before
the
beast
telling
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
to make
an image
to the
beast
that
has
the
wound
of the
sword
and
has lived
And
there was given
to it
to give
breath
to the
image
of the
beast
so that
also
should speak
the
image
of the
beast
and
should cause
that
as many as
if
not
would worship
the
image
of the
beast
would be killed
And
it causes
all
the
small
and
the
great
and
the
rich
and
the
poor
and
the
free
and
the
servants
that
it should give
them
a mark
on
the
hand
of them
-
right
or
on
the
forehead
of them
and
that
no
one
should be able
to buy
or
to sell
if
not
the [one]
having
the
mark
the
name
of the
beast
or
the
number
of the
name
of it
Here
the
wisdom
is
The [one]
having
understanding
let him count
the
number
of the
beast
number
for
a manâs
it is
and
the
number [is]
of it
six hundred
sixty
six
And
I looked
and
behold
the
Lamb
was standing
upon
-
Mount
Zion
and
with
Him
one hundred
forty
four
thousand
having
the
name
of Him
and
the
name
of the
Father
of Him
having been written
on
the
foreheads
of them
And
I heard
a voice
out of
-
heaven
as
[the] sound
of waters
many
and
as
[the] sound
of thunder
loud
And
the
voice
that
I heard
[was] like that
of harpists
harping
with
the
harps
of them
And
they are singing
a song
new
before
the
throne
and
before
the
four
living creatures
and
the
elders
And
no one
was able
to learn
the
song
if
not
the
one hundred
forty
four
thousand
-
having been redeemed
from
the
earth
These
are
they who
with
women
not
have not been defiled
pure
for
they are
these
-
following
the
Lamb
wherever
-
He shall go
These
have been redeemed
out from
-
men
[as] firstfruits
-
to God
and
to the
Lamb
And
in
the
mouth
of them
not
was found
a lie
blameless
they are
And
I saw
another
angel
flying
in
mid-heaven
having
[the] glad tidings
everlasting
to preach
upon
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
and
upon
every
nation
and
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
saying
in
a voice
loud
Fear
-
God
and
give
Him
glory
because
has come
the
hour
of the
judgment
of Him
And
worship
the [One]
having made
-
heaven
and
the
earth
and
sea
and
springs
of waters
And
another
angel
a second
followed
saying
Fallen
Fallen is
Babylon
the
great
who
of
the
wine
-
of wrath
for the
immorality
of her
she has given to drink
all
the
Gentiles
And
another
angel
a third
followed
them
saying
in
a voice
loud
If
anyone
worships
the
beast
and
the
image
of it
and
receives
a mark
on
the
forehead
of him
or
upon
the
hand
of him
also
he
will drink
of
the
wine
of the
anger
-
of God
-
having been mixed
undiluted
in
the
cup
of the
wrath
of Him
and
he will be tormented
in
fire
and
brimstone
before
[the] angels
holy
and
before
the
Lamb
And
the
smoke
of the
torment
of them
to
ages
of ages
goes up
and
not
have
rest
day
and
night
those
worshiping
the
beast
and
the
image
of it
and
if
anyone
receives
the
mark
of the
name
of it
Here
the
endurance
of the
saints
is
those
keeping
the
commandments
-
of God
and
the
faith
of Jesus
And
I heard
a voice
out of
-
heaven
saying
Write
Blessed [are]
the
dead
-
in
the Lord
dying
from
Yes
says
the
Spirit
so that
they will rest
from
the
labors
of them
-
for
the works
of them
follow
with
them
And
I looked
and
behold
a cloud
white
and
upon
the
cloud
is sitting [One]
like
[the] Son
of Man
having
on
the
head
of Him
a crown
golden
and
in
the
hand
of Him
a sickle
sharp
And
another
angel
came out
of
the
temple
crying
in
a voice
loud
to the [One]
sitting
on
the
cloud
Put forth
the
sickle
of You
and
reap
because
has come
the
hour
to reap
because
has ripened
the
harvest
of the
earth
And
swung
the [One]
sitting
upon
the
cloud
the
sickle
of Him
upon
the
earth
and
was harvested
the
earth
And
another
angel
came
out of
the
temple
-
in
-
heaven
having
also
he
a sickle
sharp
And
another
angel
came
out of
the
altar
-
having
authority
over
the
fire
and
he called
in a voice
loud
to the [one]
having
the
sickle
-
sharp
saying
Put forth
your
-
sickle
-
sharp
and
gather
the
clusters
from the
vine
of the
earth
because
have fully ripened
the
grapes
of it
And
put forth
the
angel
the
sickle
of him
to
the
earth
and
gathered
the
vine
of the
earth
and
cast [them]
into
the
winepress
of the
wrath
-
of God
-
great
And
was trodden
the
winepress
outside
the
city
and
flowed
blood
out of
the
winepress
as high as
the
bridles
of the
horses
to the distance of
stadia
one thousand
six hundred
And
I saw
another
sign
in
-
heaven
great
and
wonderful
angels
seven
having
plagues
seven
the
last
because
in
them
was completed
the
wrath
-
of God
And
I saw
[something] like
a sea
of glass
mingled
with fire
and
those
conquering
over
the
beast
and
of
the
image
of it
and
over
the
number
of the
name
of it
standing
upon
the
sea
of the
glass
having
harps
-
of God
And
they are singing
the
song
of Moses
the
servant
of
God
and
the
song
of the
Lamb
saying
Great
and
wonderful [are]
the
works
of You
Lord
-
God
the
Almighty
Righteous
and
true [are]
the
ways
of You
O
King
of the
nations
Who
no
not
should fear [You]
O Lord
and
will glorify
the
name
of You
For [You]
alone [are]
holy
For
all
the
nations
will come
and
will worship
before
You
because
the
righteous acts
of You
have been revealed
And
after
these things
I looked
and
was opened
the
temple
of the
tabernacle
of the
testimony
in
-
heaven
And
came forth
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
plagues
out
of the
temple
having been clothed in
linen
pure
bright
and
having been girded with
around
the
chests
sashes
golden
And
one
of
the
four
living creatures
gave
to the
seven
angels
seven
bowls
golden
full
of the
wrath
-
of God
the [One]
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
was filled
the
temple
with smoke
from
the
glory
-
of God
and
from
the
power
of Him
and
no one
was able
to enter
into
the
temple
until
were completed
the
seven
plagues
of the
seven
angels
And
I heard
[a] loud
voice
from
the
temple
saying
to the
seven
angels
Go
and
pour out
the
seven
bowls
of the
wrath
-
of God
into
the
earth
And
departed
the
first
and
poured out
the
bowl
of him
into
the
earth
and
came
a sore
evil
and
grievous
upon
the
men
-
having
the
mark
of the
beast
and
those
worshiping
the
image
of it
And
the
second
poured out
the
bowl
of him
into
the
sea
and
it became
blood
as
of [one] dead
and
every
soul
living
died
that was
in
the
sea
And
the
third
poured out
the
bowl
of him
into
the
rivers
and
the
springs
of the
waters
and
they became
blood
And
I heard
the
angel
of the
waters
saying
Righteous
are You
the [One]
being
and
-
having been
O
holy One
because
these things
You have judged
because
[the] blood
of saints
and
of prophets
they have poured out
and
blood
to them
You have given
to drink
worthy
they are
And
I heard
the
altar
saying
Yes
Lord
-
God
-
Almighty
true
and
righteous [are]
the
judgments
of You
And
the
fourth
poured out
the
bowl
of him
upon
the
sun
and
there was given
to it
to scorch
-
men
with
fire
And
were scorched
the
men
with heat
great
and
they cursed
the
name
-
of God
the [One]
having
-
authority
over
the
plagues
these
and
not
did they repent
to give
Him
glory
And
the
fifth
poured out
the
bowl
of him
upon
the
throne
of the
beast
and
became
the
kingdom
of it
darkened
and
they were gnawing
the
tongues
of them
for
the
distress
and
they cursed
the
God
of
heaven
on account of
the
distresses
of them
and
on account of
the
sores
of them
and
not
they did repent
of
the
works
of them
And
the
sixth
poured out
the
bowl
of him
upon
the
river
-
great
Euphrates
and
was dried up
the
water
of it
so that
might be prepared
the
way
of the
kings
-
of the
rising
of the sun
And
I saw [coming]
out of
the
mouth
of the
dragon
and
out of
the
mouth
of the
beast
and
out of
the
mouth
of the
false prophet
spirits
three
unclean
like
frogs
they are
for
spirits
of demons
performing
signs
which
go forth
to
the
kings
of the
inhabited [world]
whole
to gather together
them
unto
the
battle
of the
day
-
great
-
of God
the
Almighty
Behold
I am coming
like
a thief
Blessed [is]
the [one]
watching
and
keeping
the
garments
of him
so that
not
naked
he should walk
and
they might see
the
shame
of him
And
he gathered together
them
unto
the
place
-
called
in Hebrew
Armageddon
And
the
seventh
poured out
the
bowl
of him
upon
the
air
and
came out
a voice
loud
from
the
temple
from
the
throne
saying
It is done
And
there were
flashes of lightning
and
voices
and
thunders
and
an earthquake
there was
great
such as
not
had there been
since
-
men
were
upon
the
earth
so great
[was the] earthquake
so
mighty
And
was [split]
the
city
-
great
into
three
parts
and
the
cities
of the
nations
fell
and
Babylon
the
great
was remembered
before
-
God
to give
her
the
cup
of the
wine
of the
fury
the
wrath
of Him
And
every
island
fled
and
mountains
not
were to be found
And
a hail
great
about
a talent weight
comes down
out of
-
heaven
upon
the
men
And
blasphemed
the
men
-
God
on account of
the
plague
of the
hail
for
severe
is
the
plague
of it
exceedingly
And
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
bowls
and
spoke
with
me
saying
Come here
I will show
you
the
punishment
of the
prostitute
-
great
the [one]
sitting
upon
waters
many
with
whom
have committed sexual immorality
the
kings
of the
earth
and
have been made drunk
those that
dwelling
on the
earth
with
the
wine
of the
sexual immorality
of her
And
he carried away
me
into
a wilderness
in
[the] Spirit
and
I saw
a woman
sitting
upon
a beast
scarlet
being full
of names
of blasphemy
having
heads
seven
and
horns
ten
And
the
woman
was
clothed in
purple
and
scarlet
and
adorned
with gold
and
stone
precious
and
pearls
holding
a cup
golden
in
the
hand
of her
being full
of abominations
and
the
impurity
of the
sexual immorality
of her
And
upon
the
forehead
of her
a name
was written
a mystery
Babylon
the
Great
the
mother
of the
prostitutes
and
of the
abominations
of the
earth
And
I saw
the
woman
being drunk
with
the
blood
of the
saints
and
with
the
blood
of the
witnesses
of Jesus
And
I marveled
having seen
her
with wonder
great
And
said
to me
the
angel
Because of
why
did you marvel
I
will tell
you
the
mystery
of the
woman
and
of the
beast
-
carrying
her
-
having
the
seven
heads
and
the
ten
horns
The
beast
that
you saw
was
and
not
is
and
is about
to come up
out of
the
abyss
and
into
destruction
go
and
will wonder
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
whose
not
are written
-
names
in
the
book
-
of life
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world
seeing
the
beast
which
was
and
not
is
and yet
will be
Here [is]
the
mind
-
having
wisdom
The
seven
heads
seven
mountains
are
where
the
woman
sits
on
them
And
kings
seven
there are
The
five
are fallen
the
one
is
the
other
not yet
has come
and
when
he shall have come
a little while
him
it behooves
to remain
And
the
beast
which
was
and
not
is
also
himself
an eighth
is
and
of
the
seven
is
and
into
destruction
goes
And
the
ten
horns
which
you saw
ten
kings
are
who
a kingdom
not yet
have received
but
authority
as
kings
one
hour
receive
along with
the
beast
These
one
mind
have
and
the
power
and
authority
of themselves
to the
beast
they shall give up
These
with
the
Lamb
war will make
and
the
Lamb
will overcome
them
because
Lord
of lords
He is
and
King
of kings
and
those
with
Him
[are] called
and
chosen
and
faithful
And
he says
to me
The
waters
that
you saw
where
the
prostitute
sits
peoples
and
multitudes
are
and
nations
and
tongues
And
the
ten
horns
that
you saw
and
the
beast
these
will hate
the
prostitute
and
desolate
will make
her
and
naked
and
the
flesh
of her
they will eat
and
her
they will burn
with
fire
-
For
God
has put
into
the
hearts
of them
to do
the
purpose
of Him
and
to do
one
purpose
and
to give
the
kingdom
of them
to the
beast
until
will be fulfilled
the
words
-
of God
And
the
woman
whom
you saw
is
the
city
-
great
-
having
kingship
over
the
kings
of the
earth
After
these things
I saw
another
angel
descending
out of
-
heaven
having
authority
great
and
the
earth
was illuminated
from
the
glory
of him
And
he cried out
in
a mighty
voice
saying
Fallen
Fallen is
Babylon
the
great
And
she has become
a habitation
of demons
and
a prison
of every
spirit
unclean
and
a prison
of every
bird
unclean
and
having been hated
For
of
the
wine
of the
wrath
of the
sexual immorality
of her
have drunk
all
the
nations
and
the
kings
of the
earth
with
her
have committed sexual immorality
and
the
merchants
of the
earth
through
the
power
of the
sensuality
of her
have been enriched
And
I heard
another
voice
from
-
heaven
saying
Come
the
people
of me
out of
her
so that
not
you may have fellowship
in the
sins
of her
and
of
the
plagues
of her
so that
not
you may receive
For
have been heaped
her
-
sins
as high as
-
heaven
and
has remembered
-
God
the
iniquities
of her
Give back
to her
as
also
she
has rendered
and
pay back double
to her
twofold
according to
the
works
of her
In
the
cup
which
she has mixed
mix
to her
double
So much as
she has glorified
herself
and
lived in luxury
as much
give
to her
torment
and
misery
because
in
the
heart
of herself
she says
-
I sit
[as] a queen
and
a widow
never
I am
and
mourning
never
not
shall I see
Because of
this
in
one
day
will come
the
plagues
of her
death
and
misery
and
famine
and
with
fire
she will be burned up
because
mighty [is the]
Lord
-
God
the [One]
having judged
her
And
will weep
and
will wail
for
her
the
kings
of the
earth
the [ones]
with
her
having committed sexual immorality
and
having lived luxuriously
when
they see
the
smoke
of the
burning
of her
from
afar
standing
because of
the
fear
of the
torment
of her
saying
Woe
woe
the
city
-
great
Babylon
the
city
-
strong
For [in]
one
hour
has come
the
judgment
of you
And
the
merchants
of the
earth
weep
and
mourn
for
her
because
the
cargo
of them
no one
buys
no longer
cargo
of gold
and
of silver
and
of stone
precious
and
of pearls
and
of fine linen
and
of purple
and
of silk
and
of scarlet
and
all
wood
citron
and
every
article
of ivory
and
every
article
of
wood
most precious
and
of bronze
and
of iron
and
of marble
and
cinnamon
and
spice
and
incense
and
myrrh
and
frankincense
and
wine
and
oil
and
finest flour
and
wheat
and
cattle
and
sheep
and
of horses
and
of chariots
and
of slaves
and
souls
of men
And
the
ripe fruit
of you
of the
desire
of the
soul
are departed
from
you
and
all
the
sumptuous things
and
the
splendid things
have departed
from
you
and
no longer
no
not
them
they will find
The
merchants
of these things
-
having been enriched
from
her
from
afar
will stand
because of
the
fear
of the
torment
of her
weeping
and
mourning
saying
Woe
woe
the
city
-
great
-
having been clothed with
fine linen
and
purple
and
scarlet
and
having been adorned
with
gold
and
stone
precious
and
pearl
For [in]
one
hour
has been brought to desolation
-
such great
wealth
And
every
shipmaster
and
all
those
to
a place
sailing
and
sailors
and
as many as
the
sea
trade by
at
a distance
stood
and
were crying out
seeing
the
smoke
of the
burning
of her
saying
What [is]
like
the
city
-
great
And
they cast
dust
upon
the
heads
of them
and
they were crying out
weeping
and
mourning
saying
Woe
woe
the
city
-
great
in
which
were enriched
all
those
having
-
ships
in
the
sea
through
the
wealth
of her
For
in one
hour
she has been brought to desolation
Rejoice
over
her
O heaven
and
-
[you] saints
and
-
apostles
and
-
prophets
because
did judge
-
God
the
judgment
for you
against
her
And
took up
one
angel
a mighty
stone
like
a millstone
great
and
cast [it]
into
the
sea
saying
Thus
with violence
will be cast down
Babylon
the
great
city
and
no
not
shall be found
any longer
And
sound
of harpists
and
musicians
and
flute players
and
trumpeters
no
not
shall be heard
in
you
any longer
And
any
craftsmen
of any
craft
no
not
shall be found
in
you
any longer
and
[the] sound
of a millstone
no
not
shall be heard
in
you
any longer
And
[the] light
of lamp
no
not
shall shine
in
you
any longer
and
[the] voice
of a bridegroom
and
a bride
no
not
shall be heard
in
you
any longer
for
the
merchants
of you
were
the
great ones
of the
earth
because
by
the
sorcery
of you
were deceived
all
the
nations
And
in
her
[the] blood
of prophets
and
of saints
was found
and
of all
those
having been slain
on
the
earth
After
these things
I heard
[something] like
a voice
loud
of a multitude
great
in
-
heaven
crying out
Hallelujah
The
salvation
and
the
glory
and
the
power
to the
God
of us
For
true
and
righteous [are]
the
judgments
of Him
because
He has judged
the
prostitute
-
great
who
had corrupted
the
earth
with
the
sexual immorality
of her
and
He has avenged
the
blood
of the
servants
of Him
out of
[the] hand
of her
And
a second time
they said
Hallelujah
And
the
smoke
of her
goes up
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
fell down
the
elders
-
twenty
four
and
the
four
living creatures
and
they worshiped
-
God
the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
saying
Amen
Hallelujah
And
a voice
from
the
throne
came forth
saying
Praise
the
God
of us
all
the
servants
of Him
those
fearing
Him
the
small
and
the
great
And
I heard
[something] like
[the] voice
of a multitude
great
and
like
[the] sound
of waters
many
and
like
a sound
of thunders
mighty
saying
Hallelujah
For
has reigned
[the] Lord
-
God
of us
the
Almighty
We should rejoice
and
should exult
and
will give
the
glory
to Him
because
has come
the
marriage
of the
Lamb
and
the
bride
of Him
has made ready
herself
And
it was given
to her
that
she should be clothed in
fine linen
bright
pure
-
For
the fine linen
the
righteousness acts
of the
saints
is
And
he says
to me
Write
Blessed [are]
those
to
the
supper
of the
marriage
of the
Lamb
having been invited
And
he says
to me
These
the
words
true
-
of God
are
And
I fell
before
the
feet
of him
to worship
to him
And
he says
to me
See that you
not
A fellow servant
with you
I am
and
the
brothers
of you
-
holding
the
testimony
of Jesus
-
God
worship
The
for
testimony
of Jesus
is
the
spirit
-
of prophecy
And
I saw
-
heaven
having been opened
and
behold
a horse
white
and
the [One]
sitting
upon
it
called
Faithful
and
True
and
in
righteousness
He judges
and
makes war
-
And
the eyes
of Him
a flame
of fire
and
upon
the
head
of Him
royal crowns
many
having
a name
having been written
which
no one
knows
if
not
He Himself
and
having been clothed with
a garment
having been dipped
in blood
And
is called
the
name
of Him
The
Word
-
of God
And
the
armies
who were
in
-
heaven
were following
Him
upon
horses
white
having been clothed in
fine linen
white
pure
And
out of
the
mouth
of Him
goes forth
a sword
sharp
so that
with
it
He may strike down
the
nations
and
He
will shepherd
them
with
a rod
of iron
And
He
treads
the
press
of the
wine
of the
fury
of the
wrath
-
of God
the
Almighty
And
He has
upon
the
robe
and
upon
the
thigh
of Him
a name
having been written
King
of Kings
and
Lord
of Lords
And
I saw
one
angel
standing
in
the
sun
and
he cried out
in
a voice
loud
saying
to all
the
birds
-
flying
in
mid-heaven
Come
gather yourselves
unto
the
supper
-
great
-
of God
so that
you may eat
[the] flesh
of kings
and
[the] flesh
of commanders
and
[the] flesh
of mighty [men]
and
[the] flesh
of horses
and
of those
sitting
on
them
and
[the] flesh
of all
free
both
and
slaves
and
small
and
great
And
I saw
the
beast
and
the
kings
of the
earth
and
the
armies
of them
having been gathered together
to make
-
war
with
the [One]
sitting
on
the
horse
and
with
the
army
of Him
And
was captured
the
beast
and
with
him
the
false prophet
the [one]
having done
the
signs
before
him
by
which
he deceived
those
having received
the
mark
of the
beast
and
those
worshiping
the
image
of it
living
were cast
the
two
into
the
lake
-
of fire
-
burning
with
brimstone
And
the
rest
were killed
with
the
sword
of the [One]
sitting
on
the
horse
-
having gone forth
out of
the
mouth
of him
And
all
the
birds
were filled
with
the
flesh
of them
And
I saw
an angel
descending
out of
-
heaven
holding
the
key
of the
Abyss
and
a chain
great
in
the
hand
of him
And
he seized
the
dragon
the
serpent
-
ancient
who
is
[the] devil
and
-
Satan
and
bound
him
for a thousand
years
And
he cast
him
into
the
Abyss
and
shut
and
sealed [it]
over
him
so that
not
he should deceive
any longer
the
nations
until
were completed
the
thousand
years
After these
things
it is necessary for
to be released
him
for a little
time


























































The
rest
of the
dead
not
lived again
until
shall have been completed
the
thousand
years
This [is]
the
resurrection
-
first
Blessed
and
holy [is]
the [one]
having
a part
in
the
resurrection
-
first
Over
these
the
second
death
not
has
power
but
they will be
priests
-
of God
and
-
of Christ
and
will reign
with
Him
a
thousand
years
And
when
shall have been completed
the
thousand
years
will be released
-
Satan
out of
the
prison
of him
and
will go out
to deceive
the
nations
-
in
the
four
corners
of the
earth
-
Gog
and
Magog
to gather together
them
unto
the
war
of whom
the
number [is]
of them
like
the
sand
of the
sea
And
they marched up
over
the
breadth
of the
earth
and
encircled
the
camp
of the
saints
and
the
city
-
having been beloved
But
came down
fire
out of
-
heaven
and
devoured
them
And
the
devil
the [one]
deceiving
them
was cast
into
the
lake
-
of fire
and
of sulfur
where [are]
also
the
beast
and
the
false prophet
and
they will be tormented
day
and
night
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
I saw
a throne
great
white
and
the [One]
sitting
on
it
whose
from
-
face
fled
the
earth
and
-
heaven
and
place
not
was found
for them
And
I saw
the
dead
-
great
and
-
small
standing
before
the
throne
and
books
were opened
And
another
book
was opened
which
is
the [one]
of life
And
were judged
the
dead
out of
the things
having been written
in
the
books
according to
the
deeds
of them
And
gave up
the
sea
the
dead
who were
in
it
and
-
Death
and
-
Hades
gave up
the
dead
who were
in
them
and
they were judged
each [of them]
according to
the
works
of them
And
-
Death
and
-
Hades
were cast
into
the
lake
-
of fire
This
the
death
-
second
is
the
lake
of
fire
And
if
anyone
not
was found
in
the
book
-
of life
having been written
he was cast
into
the
lake
-
of fire
And
I saw
a heaven
new
and
an earth
new
-
for
the first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
had passed away
and
the
sea
not
is
any longer
And
the
city
-
holy
[the] Jerusalem
new
I saw
coming down
out of
-
heaven
from
-
God
having been prepared
as
a bride
having been adorned
for the
husband
of her
And
I heard
a voice
great
from
the
throne
saying
Behold
the
tabernacle
-
of God
[is] with
-
men
and
He will tabernacle
with
them
and
they
peoples
of Him
will be
and
Himself
-
God
with
them
will be
And
He will wipe away
every
tear
from
the
eyes
of them
and
-
death
not
will be
any longer
nor
mourning
nor
crying
nor
pain
not
they will be
any longer
because
the
former things
have passed away
And
said
the [One]
sitting
on
the
throne
Behold
new
I make
all things
And
He says
Write [this]
because
these
the
words
faithful
and
true
are
And
He said
to me
It is done
I
the
Alpha
and
the
Omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
I
to the [one]
thirsting
will give
of
the
spring
of the
water
-
of life
freely
The [one]
overcoming
will inherit
all things
and
I will be
his
God
and
he
will be
My
son
-
But
to the cowardly
and
unbelieving
and
having become abominable
and
murderers
and
the sexually immoral
and
sorcerers
and
idolaters
and
all
-
liars
the
portion
of them
[is] in
the
lake
-
burning
with fire
and
brimstone
which
is
the
death
-
second
And
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
bowls
-
being full
of the
seven
plagues
-
last
and
spoke
with
me
saying
Come here
I will show
you
the
bride
the
wife
of the
Lamb
And
he carried away
me
in
[the] Spirit
to
a mountain
great
and
high
and
he showed
me
the
city
-
holy
Jerusalem
descending
out of
-
heaven
from
-
God
having
the
glory
-
of God
The
radiance
of it
[was] like
a stone
most precious
like
a stone
jasper
being clear as crystal
having
a wall
great
and
high
having
gates
twelve
and
at
the
gates
angels
twelve
and
names
having been inscribed
which
are
of the
twelve
tribes
of [the] sons
of Israel
On
[the] east
[were] gates
three
and
on
[the] north
gates
three
and
on
[the] south
gates
three
and
on
[the] west
gates
three
And
the
wall
of the
city
had
foundations
twelve
and
in
them
[the] twelve
names
of the
twelve
apostles
of the
Lamb
And
the [one]
speaking
with
me
had
a measuring
reed
golden
so that
he could measure
the
city
and
the
gates
of it
and
the
wall
of it
And
the
city
foursquare
lies
and
the
length
of it [is]
the same as
the
width
And
he measured
the
city
with the
reed
at
stadia
twelve
thousand
The
length
and
the
breadth
and
the
height
of it
equal
are
And
he measured
the
wall
of it
one hundred
forty
four
cubits
[the] measure
of man
that
is
of the angel
And
the
structure
of the
wall
of it
[was] jasper
and
the
city
gold
pure
like
glass
clear
the
foundations
of the
wall
of the
city
with every
stone
precious
having been adorned
the
foundation
-
first
jasper
the
second
sapphire
the
third
chalcedony
the
fourth
emerald
the
fifth
sardonyx
the
sixth
sardius
the
seventh
chrysolite
the
eighth
beryl
the
ninth
topaz
the
tenth
chrysoprase
the
eleventh
jacinth
the
twelfth
amethyst
And
the
twelve
gates [were]
twelve
pearls
respectively
one
each
of the
gates
was
of
one
pearl
and
the
street
of the
city
gold
pure
as
glass
transparent
And
temple
not
I saw
in
it
-
for
the Lord
-
God
-
Almighty
temple
of it
is
and
the
Lamb
And
the
city
no
need
has
of the
sun
nor
of the
moon
that
they should shine
in it
the
for
glory
-
of God
enlightened
it
and
the
lamp
of it
[is] the
Lamb
And
will walk
the
nations
by
the
light
of it
and
the
kings
of the
earth
bring
the
glory
of them
into
it
And
the
gates
of it
no
not
shall be shut
by day
night
for
not
will be
there
And
they will bring
the
glory
and
the
honor
of the
nations
into
it
And
no
not
shall enter
into
it
anything
defiling
and
those
practicing
abomination
and
a lie
if
not
those
having been written
in
the
book
-
of life
of the
Lamb
And
he showed
me
a river
of water
of life
clear
as
crystal
flowing
out of
the
throne
-
of God
and
of the
Lamb
In
the middle
of the
street
of it
and
of the
river
on this side
and
on that side
[was a] tree
of life
producing
fruits
twelve
according to
month
each
yielding
the
fruit
of it
and
the
leaves
of the
tree
[are] for
[the] healing
of the
nations
And
any
curse
not
there will be
any longer
And
the
throne
-
of God
and
of the
Lamb
in
it
will be
and
the
servants
of Him
will serve
Him
And
they will see
the
face
of Him
and
the
name
of Him
[will be] on
the
foreheads
of them
And
night
not
there will be
there
and
not
they have
need
of [the] light
of a lamp
and
of [the] light
of [the] sun
because
[the] Lord
-
God
will enlighten
upon
them
and
they will reign
to
the
ages
of the
ages
And
he said
to me
These
-
words
[are] faithful
and
true
And
the
Lord
the
God
of the
spirits
of the
prophets
sent
the
angel
of Him
to show
the
servants
of Him
the things that
must
come to pass
in
quickness
And
behold
I am coming
quickly
Blessed [is]
the [one]
keeping
the
words
of the
prophecy
of the
book
this
And I
John
[am] the [one]
hearing
and
seeing
these things
And
when
I heard
and
saw
I fell down
to worship
before
the
feet
of the
angel
-
showing
me
these things
And
he says
to me
See that you
not
Fellow servant
of you
I am
and
with the
brothers
of you
the
prophets
and
with those
keeping
the
words
of the
book
this
-
God
worship
And
he says
to me
Not
seal
the
words
of the
prophecy
of the
book
this
the
time
for
near
is
The [one]
being unrighteous
let him be unrighteous
still
and
he who
is filthy
let him be filthy
still
and
he who
[is] righteous
righteousness
let him practice
still
and
he who [is]
holy
let him be holy
still
Behold
I am coming
quickly
and
the
reward
of Me
[is] with
Me
to give
to each
as
the
work
is
his
I [am]
the
Alpha
and
the
Omega
the
First
and
the
Last
the
Beginning
and
the
End
Blessed [are]
those
washing
the
robes
of them
that
will be
the
right
of them
to
the
tree
-
of life
and
by the
gates
they shall enter
into
the
city
Outside [are]
the
dogs
and
the
sorcerers
and
the
sexually immoral
and
the
murderers
and
the
idolaters
and
everyone
loving
and
practicing
falsehood
I
Jesus
have sent
the
angel
of Me
to testify
to you
these things
in
the
churches
I
am
the
root
and
the
offspring
of David
the
star
-
bright
-
morning
And
the
Spirit
and
the
bride
say
Come
And
the [one]
hearing
let him say
Come
And
the [one]
thirsting
let him come
the [one]
desiring
let him take
[the] water
of life
freely
Testify
I
to everyone
-
hearing
the
words
of the
prophecy
of the
book
this
If
anyone
should add
to
these things
will add
-
God
unto
him
the
plagues
-
having been written
in
the
book
this
And
if
anyone
should take away
from
the
words
of the
book
of the
prophecy
this
will take away
-
God
the
part
of him
from
the
tree
-
of life
and
out of
the
city
-
holy
of those
having been written
in
the
book
this
Says
the [One]
testifying
these things
Yes
I am coming
quickly
Amen
Come

Jesus
The
